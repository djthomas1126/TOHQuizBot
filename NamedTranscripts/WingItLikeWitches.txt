Boscha: You are talented. You are a star. You may be hated, so long as you are feared.
Boscha: Most important of all, you are a winner.
Old Woman 1: There she goes, captain of the Banshees. Off to win another championship for Hexside.
Old Woman 2: Why can't you be more like her?
Boscha: Alright, girls. You know the drill. Captain goes first. Hello, Hexside! Your star has arrived. Groveling line starts here. Something's not right. Nobody's here!
Hexside Student: No way!
Potions Student: Do me next. Do me! 
Potions Student: Welcome to the world, little buddy. You're the coolest, Willow.
Willow: Aw, shucks!
Bird Student: Yeah, Willow rules!
Boscha: Wow, she has to make friends out of plants. How sad.
Amity: Oh, please! You know, I used to be like you, Boscha, obsessed with status, challenging my competition. But I grew up. When will you?
Boscha: Oh, this is not gonna fly.
Luz: My first grudgby season! I'm so excited, I have more school spirit than the school spirits!
Ghost: Why do I even bother? 
Eda: Ah, grudgby season is the best. You know, I used to play, back in my gory days.
Luz: You mean "glory days"?
Eda: Well, that too. I was unstoppable on the field. I had the best moves and the best cheats.
Luz: Cheating isn't anything to brag about. How do you know you were any good if all you did was cheat your way to victory?
Eda: Ugh. What do humans know, with your goody-goody attitude? If "cheaters never prosper", why was I the star player?
Luz: Well, can't reason with crazy. Bye, King, you little snoozers.
King: Ugh. Eda, when was the last time you cleaned up in here? Get your own scalp, buddy. This one's taken. 
Eda: All this talk of grudgby has me feeling nostalgic. Whaddya say you and me take a little trip down memory lane?
King: Hard pass.
Eda: That's the spirit.
Ghost: You mean me?
Eda: Ugh. Come on! 
Ghost: Oh.
Teacher: Over 50 years ago, Emperor Belos appointed a head witch to each coven. 
Luz: I can't wait for grudgby season to start! I've studied up on all sorts of magical sports. Like this. Good Witch Azura 2: The Field of Deadly Fates. A classic underdog tale.
Willow: Azura challenges Hecate in the smibbitch championship. But will she risk it all by taking a chance on the deadly Thorn Vault? 
Gus: Ooh, a shiny cookie. 
Luz: Not food.
Teacher: The council headquarters was built and paid for by...? Anyone? Willow?
Willow: Uh, the Pixie Dust Taxes?
Bird Student: Whoo, yeah! Go, Willow!
Teacher: Impressive, Miss Park.
Luz: What's going on? It's like all of Hexside's caught Willow fever!
Willow: Ever since I patched things up with Amity, I've been feeling more confident. I guess it shows.
Boscha: Aw, Willow thinks she's popular now. How cute.
Luz: Hey, I agree, my friend is very cute. But give that back!
Boscha: It's weird that Amity hangs out with you now. Ever since Grom, she's gone soft. But don't worry. I'm still here to show you who's boss.
Gus: Here, Willow.
Boscha: Oh-ho-ho! The friends wanna get in on this too, huh?
Teacher: Is that laughter? Hey, hey! Learning's not supposed to be fun!
Luz: We are having zero fun, I swear. Boscha's picking on us.
Boscha: My apologies, sir. I was practicing my aim for grudgby. 
Teacher: Boscha, how could you throw things at them... when you could throw things at me? Am I over here? Or am I over here? Anything for the captain of the Banshees! 
Boscha: Oh, thanks, but I already have the perfect targets. 
Willow: Oh! 
Luz: Don't worry, it's not like she can follow us around all day, right?
Luz: She followed us around all day. She literally followed us around all day!
Willow: I'm really sorry I pulled you guys into this. We should have just kept a low profile. Boscha could get away with murder if she wanted to. 
Principal Bump: What's this? Boscha got away with murder? I can't say I approve, but at least she's trying new things. 
Luz: We will find a way out of this. 
Luz: Amity! 
Amity: (nervous) Oh, Luz! You're here! I mean, obviously you're here, this is school, and you go here now, with, uh, me... I've been talking for too long. 
Luz: Amity, we need your help.
Amity: Yes, I can help! With what, exactly?
Luz: Boscha won't stop picking on Willow, and no one will do anything about it because she's the "Star Captain of the Grudgby Team".
Amity: Yeah, this time of year, she's extra unbearable. 
Luz: You're friends with her, can you help us? (She gets closer to Amity.)
Amity: (blushes again, backs up) Uh, the hard part is, there's no reasoning with Boscha. She only speaks in grudgby terms. 
Luz: Hmm. Okay, okay. I'm pickin' up what you're puttin' down. 
Amity: I'm... not putting anything down. 
Luz: Willow! What happened?
Willow: Boscha happened.
Boscha: Hey, Willow! I just thought all trash should stay in one spot. 
Luz: That's it! Boscha! Willow challenges you to... a grudgby match! 
Boscha: She what? 
Willow: I what?
Gus: She what? Seriously, what's going on here? 
Eda: And here's when we took down Epiderm High in the semi-finals. Oh, I was the youngest on the team, but I had what some call "star power". AKA, this. This is my cheat box. I have all my best weapons in here. Smoke bombs, sock-worms... Mwah. You name it. Oh, I never lost a game with this bad boy. 
Hooty: Hoot-hoot! Guess who found a special friend in the forest. It was me. Hoot!
Eda: Lilith. 
Lilith: Edalyn.
Hooty: Hooty!
Eda: Ugh. Scram, Hooty.
Hooty: Okay!
Lilith: Why are you in your old uniform? 
Eda: No reason. It's laundry day. What are you doing here?
Lilith: Edalyn Clawthorne, you are hereby under arrest by the order of the Emperor of the Boiling Isles—
Lilith: Ah!
Eda: You were saying? 
Lilith: Come on! I have to bring you in. It's time for you to join the coven. The Emperor has big plans for the Isles, and he wants you to be a part of it all.
Eda: Ooh, Aah. What an incredible opportunity for me. 
Lilith: What are you even looking at? Grudgby pictures? Feeling sentimental?
Eda: Pah! Me? Never. I was just telling King here how good I was. 
Lilith: Oh, Edalyn. Not only is the curse affecting your hair, but your memory as well. 
Eda: Ah, tell you what. I'll go with you peacefully to the Emperor...
Lilith: Really?
Eda: Sure. If you beat me at a game of grudgby. Luz is always challenging people to things. Why not me?
Lilith: Hmm... Game on. 
Willow: Luz, what are you doing? 
Luz: I'm just following Amity's advice. Boscha only speaks in grudgby terms. Trust me, I have a plan. 
Boscha: Okay, maybe it's the altitude of the second floor, but I thought I heard you say that Leaf Girl wanted to challenge me to a grudgby match.
Luz: That's right! We'll settle this once and for all on the field.
Willow: Or we could just talk about our issues.
Boscha: Let's do this.
Willow: Oh, no. 
Luz: If Willow's team wins, you don’t get to pick on her anymore.
Boscha: Fine! And when we win, Willow and your team will be our water gofers.
Luz: Ha! That's not even a punishment. I love water. 
Boscha: And we get to use you as target practice.
Boscha: See you after school, losers.
Bird Student: Whoo-hoo! Willow verses Boscha!
Amity: Luz, this isn't a good idea.
Willow: Yeah, I've never even played grudgby before! How am I supposed to beat Boscha? 
Luz: But you're the better witch. I don't know much about sports, but I know about sports movies. We, too, are a ragtag team of lovable misfits joined together to defeat a powerful enemy. With a little team spirit and a training montage, we can win. 
Willow: Well, if you think this'll work, then I'm in. How about you, Gus?
Gus: In seasons past, these flags have waved in support of grudgby greats. Now they will wave for the greatest: Me! 
Luz: What about you, Amity? 
Amity: Me? On a team with you? Running around in cute uniforms? Sweating? I gotta go!
Luz: Huh? Well, I guess she's out. In any case, let's get training! 
Luz: So, how exactly do we play grudgby? 
Gus: Well, there's a ball, and you score by getting the ball through the other team's goal. 
Luz: That sounds easy.
Willow: It is, except...
Luz: Oh, right. Boiling Isles. Should have predicted this. 
Luz: Alright! Every great sports story includes a training montage. 
Gus: What's a "mon-tage"?
Luz: Well...
Gus: Oh, I get it now. Wait, were we just having a tea party in animal jammies?
Luz: What happens in the montage stays in the montage! Now let's hit the field.
Bird Student: Woo! Go Willow!
Bird Student: You'll get 'em next time!
Willow: I need a cup of water.
Luz: Now for our big finale! Let's try... the Thorn Vault. 
Willow: Luz, wait—
Willow: Gus! Talk to me, Gus! 
Gus: I—I think something's broken. My flags! I never should have tried to play. You were always enough for me. 
Willow: Come on, Gus. I have some floral tape in the greenhouse. We'll fix them.
Gus: Okay.
Luz: Guys, let's try the Thorn Vault one more time. 
Willow: Not now, Luz. We're tired.
Luz: But we're the underdogs, we have to stay upbeat and keep trying and—
Willow: Luz! Not everything can be solved with a good attitude and a dope music soundtrack. We're going to lose. And no movie can help us against that. The game is off. 
Luz: Willow, wait! 
Hooty: You gals ready to hoot? We want a clean game here, so no magic allowed. 
King: Yes! Now I'll strike fear into my enemies with this armor of intimidation.
Eda: Yeah, intimidation armor. Pushing paper all day might make you a little rusty. I'll try to go easy on you.
Lilith: Remember, dear sister, you may have been star player, but I was team captain for a reason.
Amity: Tough practice? 
Luz: I pushed Willow and Gus too hard. It's just, I hate seeing Willow get picked on. She's one of the best friends I've ever had. Winning this game is the only way I know how to help. 
Amity: Did you know, before Boscha, I was the grudgby team captain? 
Luz: Really?
Amity: Well, once I left the team, I decided that was a part of my life I wanted to forget. 
Amity: We were playing Glandus High for the Island Championship. We had a move planned, and it was a good one. But, at the last minute, I decided I wanted to do something a bit flashier. I changed our game plan to... the Thorn Vault.
Luz: Good Witch Azura 2: Field of Deadly Fates! You watched it too?
Amity: Uh, yeah.
Amity: It went disastrously wrong. My teammates got hurt. All because I had an idea of how things should be. I pushed them too far.
Amity: I never played again after that day.
Luz: Wah! Sorry. I just really love backstories.
Luz: I know what to do to make this up to Willow. Thanks. 
Boscha: It's after school. Where's the leader of your loser brigade? 
Luz: I'm here on her behalf. We forfeit.
Luz: And I'm here to tell you that I'll take Willow's place as your water gofer, target practice, whatever you need. 
Boscha: Wow, you're really a good friend. And a perfect target. 
Boscha: Think fast!
Willow: There, that ought to do it. 
Gus: These are flags of surrender now.
Amity: Luz needs our help! I know she pushed you guys, and she always gets in over her head. She can be so stupid, which I love— (blushes) I mean hate! In any case, she needs you right now, which is sweet— I mean, I hate it, and it's dumb!
Gus: You lost me.
Amity: Just, here. 
Gus: Can we resist the call to action? No! May the flags be raised once more.
Hooty: Hoot!
Eda: Hooty! Whose side are you on?
Hooty: I'm an unbiased participant, hoot-hoot.
King: Point goes to Lilith. We're at a tie here, folks.
Hooty: Time for one more play. 
Eda: Just one little trick and the game will be mine. 
Eda: Dang it, Luz! Your nonsense has gotten into my head. Well, time to do this the old-fashioned way.
Lilith: Taking your time. Nervous?
Eda: Not today, sister.
Hooty: It's me again!
Hooty: Ow!
Hooty: Oh geez, hey!
Lilith: No!
Eda: Yeah!
King: Ha ha! Game over! Team Owl House rules supreme!
Eda: Yes! Still got it! Still got the skills to pay the bills!
Lilith: No! No! I can't go back to the Emperor empty-handed.
Eda: Here. Tell them I put up a heck of a struggle. 
Lilith: I will be back for you. And next time, I won't be alone. 
Eda: I'll be waiting.
Hooty: I'll be waiting too! Hoot-hooty-hoot!
Boscha: Having fun yet? 'Cause I'm just getting warmed up.
Boscha: Huh?
Willow: Boscha. Your issue is with me, not Luz. Leave her be. 
Luz: Willow! Willow, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. You're right, I got my head too stuck in the movie biz.
Willow: It's okay. I know you were just trying help in your Luz way. But now let's finish this... my way. The game is back on.
Boscha: You need three players on your team. Where's your third?
Willow: Uh, well...
Amity: Right here. 
Boscha: You just destroyed your social life.
Amity: Nah. I think I made it better. 
Boscha: Ugh! Game on!
Gus: Go Willow!
Willow: There's something on your shoe.
Boscha: Like I'd fall for that.
Bosha: Huh?
Boscha: Oh!
Luz: Nice work.
Amelia: Thanks.
Boscha: Hmm.
Luz: Whoa.
Luz: Fire magic! Amity!
Amity: Yeah! 
Amity: There's time for one more play.
Willow: And this play could determine whether us underdogs win or lose. 
Luz: Here's what I have to offer. 
Willow: I think we should try... this one. 
Luz: The Thorn Vault? Are you sure? 
Willow: I'm ready this time. 
Luz: Ha!
Amity: Watch out! 
Luz: Amity!
Amity: Luz! 
Luz: Whoo! You did it, Willow! We did it! We won!
Luz: Wait, what?
Willow: Oh, thorns.
Luz: Wh-What happened?
Willow: She caught the Rusty Smidge.
Luz: The what?
Boscha: Yeah, while you were celebrating your "victory", I caught this guy. It means we automatically win. All magic sports are like this. 
Luz: That just invalidates all our efforts! If catching that thing is so important, why do anything else? There's no reason to watch any of the other players! That's such a stupid rule!
Boscha: Well, we beat them and proved our social dominance. All is right in the hierarchy. 
Boscha: Hey!
Skara: Good game, Willow! 
Amelia: I had so much fun playing you guys.
Willow: Oh, really?
Cat: Willow, you're really good. Would you want to be on our team? 
Willow: Mm, thanks for the offer, but I think I'm done with grudgby for a while. Hey, where's...
Luz and Willow: Amity! 
Amity: I think—I think I hurt my leg. But, I'll be okay. 
Luz: Are you sure? I could help carry you if it really hurts.
Amity: I'm fine! Who's Amity?
Luz: And, scoop! 
Amity: Oh, wow. Sports. 
Gus: Can we have another montage? 
Luz: Yeah! Montage, activate! 
King: You're—You're not gonna show this to anyone, right?
Eda: Of course not. Keep cheering.
