"Luz": Ah! Much better.
"Luz": Hmm.
Camila: What's the box for, mija? 
"Luz": Just cleaning up a little. 
Camila: Even this? You used to love making me tinfoil swans.
"Luz": Oh, I'm, uh, just looking for a fresh start.
"Luz": Camp taught me a lot, you know? 
Camila: Yes, it sure did...
Camila: Ah! Luz, grab the pliers.
Camila: Okay, okay, little bunny, you're gonna be all right. There we go.
"Luz": That's the fifth trap this week!
Camila: If I ever catches who's responsible and then I'll pa-pow!
Camila: Let's go back inside. I will make maduros.
"Luz": A new life. 
Luz: You! 
Luz: So, according to Philip's instructions, the hardest part to making a portal was finding someone who knew how to build it. But a lot of the ingredients are pretty easy to find. Your crazy apocalypse supplies finally came in handy, Eda!
King: Don't forget this. 
Luz: Titan blood. I can't believe something this powerful was in the old key this whole time.
Luz: It's okay. If Belos is still trying to get to the Human Realm, he'll have to beat me to it.
Eda: Are you sure this isn't gonna like, blow our faces off?
Luz: Nope!
Eda: Well, here goes something.
Luz: It... worked! 
King: Did it? That looks real different from the old door!
Luz: Yeah. But this is my one chance to see my mom. If it looks like it's closing, pull!
Eda: Luz, as impressive as this is, I don't want you getting hurt.
Luz: Once I make sure my mom is okay, I'll be right back.
Eda: Just be careful. The Human Realm's filled with some real weirdos. 
Luz: Mmm!
King: Don't forget to mention me!
Luz: Okay.
Luz: Did I... do something wrong? Eda? King? Hooty? Can anyone hear me?
Luz: Am I... back at the Owl House?
Luz: Whoa! Whoa, I think I'm... in the reflection! 
King: Do you think she's safe?
Eda: She's made it this far. We just have to trust her.
Luz: I wonder if I can see... Amity! 
Luz: Ah! Ugh! No, no, no! Come on, Luz, you're on a mission! Camila! Camila Noceda of the Human Realm?
Luz: Got ya! Ice platform!
Luz: Fine then! I'll do this the hard way!
Luz: Mom!
Luz: It's my house!
Luz: Mom!
Camila: Oh yeah.
Luz: Mo—
"Luz": Mom? Do you need any help?
Camila: Oh, are you done cleaning your room?
"Luz": Almost! With all that old stuff gone, I feel like a whole new person.
Luz: Evil doppelgänger! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
Camila: I can finish up here, mija.
"Luz": Thanks, Mom! 
Luz: Follow her! Luz Noceda 2.0! Doppelgänger! Why won't you work?! Okay, Luz, calm down. Just breathe and count to five.
"Luz": A new life. 
Luz: You!
Luz: So you can hear me.
"Luz": You're from the Demon Realm.
Luz: Listen, I just wanna—
"Luz": I'm not going back! I—I won't go back! 
Camila: Luz? ¿Está todo bien?
Luz: Sí, Mama! I just saw a spoiler from Monster Slayer Academia!
Camila: I'll never understand anime.
Luz: Hmm?
Luz: Wait!
"Luz": So this is it. I'm gonna have to run... again. Why couldn't this just work out?!
Luz: Stop moving! You'll make it tighter!
Basilisk: Huh?
Luz: I didn't mean to freak you out. I just want to figure out what's going on, okay? You're a demon from the Boiling Isles, aren't you?
Basilisk: Mm-hmm. 
Luz: What's your name?
Basilisk: I'm Number F—I mean, I'm Vee.
Luz: Okay Vee, I'm gonna help free you. You're gonna be alright. Now, back up a bit, give the wire some slack. Now, look for a little metal thingamabobber. Sorry, I don't know what it's called.
Luz: There you go, nice and easy.
Vee: Ah! Thank you. You must be Camila's real daughter.
Luz: I am. But right now, I'm trapped in the Boiling Isles. Who are you, why are you pretending to be me?
Vee: I am... just looking for a place to belong.
Vee: You're missing and mom... I mean, Camila seemed so kind, so I stayed with her but uh, I'll go if you—
Luz: Wait, wait, wait! Maybe we can help each other! Today I was gonna tell my mom where I've been, but because of you, she hasn't realized that I've been missing! So, keep living in my place! For now. When I get back, I can introduce her to the Demon Realm and help you find a place to live.
Vee: There's one problem. I need magic to transform and I, uh... just used the rest of it.
Luz: Hmm... Oh! That's where we can get some magic!
Vee: Secrets of Gravesfield?
Luz: No, no, that's junk. Turn it over.
Vee: Strange woman banned from café.
Luz: That's Eda the Owl Lady. She's been coming here for years. She might have left some magic stuff behind!
Vee: Okay! We can try.
Vee: Is this it? Huh, I—I just go in and ask about that witch from the paper?
Luz: Yes. Maybe they still have one of her enchanted pastries! Huh? Ears! Ears!
Shopkeeper: Hello!
Shopkeeper: What can I get ya?
Vee: Uh, have any, um, magical old ladies left enchanted items here?
Shopkeeper: Ugh, you're not friends with that witch-obsessed guy, right? I told him to stop leaving pamphlets here!
Vee: Actually, I'm asking about her.
Shopkeeper: Oh, Marylin?
Shopkeeper: Yeah, she tried to pay for a latte with a live raccoon a couple of months ago. But when I called the cops, she did something weird to the croissants. We threw 'em in the trash but... Well, now we have a whole new problem.
Vee: I don't... smell any magic. Huh?
Rats: Bread of wisdom grants us speech. We desire more!
Luz: Cool! Talking rats! Maybe they know something.
Luz: Vee? Is everything alright?
Vee: Oh, yeah, I—I just don't like confrontation. 
Luz: Oh! Well, that's okay. I'm sure there's someone else who's seen Eda. There!
Luz: Hexes Hold'em cards! Eda got rid of all her decks. I was wondering where they went...
Vee: Well, they must've run out of magic, I don't... smell anything.
Luz: But maybe they know where to get more! Okay, we gotta be careful approaching high schoolers. Mark all your exit routes—
Vee: Actually, these guys are cool. 
Luz: Ah! Wait, hey!
Masha: A past connection that left its mark on your soul has shown up again, and it's asking you to shed your old ways and enter a metamorphosis! Becoming a spiritual leader, you're meant to be.
Boy: Yeah, that sounds about right. 
Vee: Hello!
Luz: Oh, she's gonna embarrass herself! I can't watch...
Masha: Oh, hey, Luz! Good to see you outside of prison.
Vee: Come on! Camp wasn't that bad.
Luz: Camp?
Vee: We did have the best cabin!
Vee and High Schoolers: Cabin 7! Hoo-ha-ha! 
Vee: Cool cards! Where'd you get 'em?
Masha: Uh-uh. Let me give you a reading first. I wanna practice.
High Schoolers (excluding Masha): Woah.
Masha: You're running from your past. From a previous life that was not kind to you. However, the guilt and fear you carry will eventually catch you in a self-fulfilling prophecy that you won't be able to escape from.
Masha: You're gonna need some bath bombs, girl.
Masha: Anyway, I got the cards over at the Gravesfield Historical Society.
Vee: Thanks. I'll see you around.
Masha: Did you see the look in her eyes? I gotta find out where she got those contacts.
Jacob: Is it that dusty in here? Welcome to the Gravesfield Historical Society. Lemme guess, you're here to buy those weird cards, right?
Vee: How did you know?
Jacob: Well, they've been really popular with high schoolers. Yeah, saw an old lady try to dump 'em in a river a while back, but I bought them off her instead. Was really odd though, she kept asking for snails.
Luz: This is it!
Jacob: You want a set?
Vee: Yes, please!
Jacob: Well, I'll be just a minute, so feel free to look around.
Luz: Are you okay? Hey, forget what that girl said! I know what it's like to run away from home. I did the same thing.
Vee: You and I are not the same. You had a mom who loved you, a home, a life, you had it good! And you still wanted to run away, I... I didn't have a choice. My real name is... Number Five. I'm a basilisk, and technically, I... I shouldn't exist.
Vee: My kind went extinct a long time ago, but we were brought back.
Vee: They wanted to know how we drained magic.
Luz: I met a basilisk once. She hurt a lot of people.
Vee: For many of us, all we knew how to do was feed.
Vee: Some of us escaped, but I knew it was only a matter of time before he caught us again.
Vee: That's when I saw you, and... and realized there might be a way out of this!
Camila: Luz? Where are you?
Vee: Eeh! 
Camila: Luz? There you are.
Vee (as Luz): Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!
Camila: Very funny. But, I was thinking, instead of taking the bus to camp, why don't we drive? I got the day off from work, and you'll have full control of the playlist.
Vee: I didn't mean to keep playing this role, but... Camila was nice to me.
Vee: I resent you for running away. But I'm also thankful that you did. I dunno. It's... confusing.
Luz: Do you smell something?
Vee: Where's the light?
Vee: What is all this?
Luz: Vee? Vee? Vee?
Luz (in reflection): Vee!
Vee: Let me out!
Jacob: Woah, it worked?
Jacob: I—I can't believe it, are you real? After all that time, after setting up all those traps, I... I finally caught a living, breathing demon! Oh, don't be surprised. A few years back I had a chance encounter with another one of your kind. 
Jacob: Yeah, at first I couldn't believe what I saw, but after watching a few MewTube videos I learned the truth. Witches and demons are real...
Jacob: ... and they're all sent from Mars to harvest human teeth to power their time machine!
Vee: You... don't actually know anything about us, do you?
Jacob: Oh, I know enough. I'll expose your vile plans on MewTube and finally... get my account verified. Get comfortable, demon. Cause you'll be in cages for the rest of your life. 
Luz: Don't worry, Vee, we can get out of this...
Vee: Go back to the Demon Realm, Luz.
Luz: Huh?
Vee: Even if I get out, he knows what my disguise looks like. He'd out me to Camila and it'd would cause her more trouble than if you just disappeared.
Luz: Vee! You're giving up too quick!
Vee: I'm being realistic. It's okay, I'm used to living like this. Goodbye, Luz.
Luz: No!
Luz: Vee! Five! Number Five! Agh! 
Luz: Camila Noceda.
Camila: Boop.
Luz: Mom, are you there?
Camila: Huh? Luz? I didn't even hear you call!
Luz: Mom. It's so great to hear your voice.
Camila: Oh. It's great to hear you too? What's wrong?
Luz: I found out who's setting up those traps, and he's... hurting a friend of mine. But first... I have to tell you the truth. About the last few months. Let me tell you about a place called Boiling Isles.
Camila: You know, if you wanted me to pick you and your friend up, you didn't have to make up this elaborate story about the "Demon Realm".
Luz: I'm not making it up, Mom.
Camila: Don't worry, I'll play along. I know this stuff made school difficult, but I'm glad you're still being creative.
Camila: Are you the curator here?
Jacob: Who's askin'?
Camila: A little birdie told me you caught a demon! I would love to see it!
Jacob: Wait, how did you know? Do you work for the government?
Camila: Oh. I'm a veterinarian, actually.
Jacob: So, the President sent a vet to study the demon's anatomy, huh? Sure. But first, I'll need verbal confirmation that I get to publish my findings first. 
Camila: Uh... 'kay.
Jacob: Good. Now you're bound by law. Follow me.
Camila: You even made me a part of your game! Ooh, This is so fun.
Camila: Ooh! Is this one of those escape rooms? Or, um, what do you call them, a LARP? Oh, sorry, don't want to break the illusion.
Jacob: Let me start by telling you the secret history of Gravesfield.
Jacob: In the 1600s, this was a peaceful colony. Until, tragedy struck.
Jacob: Two brothers were lured into a realm of evil by a real witch, never to be seen again. People have stopped believing in the horrors of witchcraft, but... I know the truth.
Camila: Woah. Luz, this is quite a detailed story.
Jacob: But now I've got proof that otherworldly beings exist! Behold!
Camila: Oh, wow! That is a very... convincing... costume? 
Jacob: A costume? This is a real life demon! C'mere, watch this.
Jacob: More vile beings will probably come to its rescue. But I can protect humanity. I even had some custom gear made at the renaissance fair. Usually I don't take it out for just anyone, but what the heck! If I'm gonna be working with the government, I might as well show off a little.
Camila: Luz, come on. I don't like this game anymore.
Luz: It's not a game, Mama. Everything I told you was true.
Camila: So that thing has been living with me the entire time? It's just a lot to believe...
Luz: Her name is Vee, and she may look different, but she's not bad. Please, you gotta help her!
Camila: Hello... this is all so confusing, but... who knew I had such a strong girl living under my roof this whole time?
Jacob: So how do I look? Maybe we can collaborate on a version that can survive the battles on Mars? Wait, what is that? Are you recording this?
Camila: Uh...
Jacob: Wonderful! Well I was gonna wait until after the press tour, but let's begin our live dissection of this demon right now!
Camila: Stop! Uh, the... the President just called. Yeah, and, uh...
Camila: Uh... Y'know what? I don't have the imagination for this. I will be taking this innocent child with me, and you will never bother us again.
Jacob: What? No absolutely not! We made a verbal agreement—
Camila: Mister. You better back the heck down, or I will tell the police you have been illegally setting up traps and cameras on private property! 
Jacob: I won't let you take away my discovery. I'm the good guy here!
Camila: Yeah. A lot of bad guys say that.
Vee: Is it okay to leave him in there?
Camila: He'll be fine.
Camila: He can use the time for some self-reflection.
Luz: Heh! Look what I can do with the rain! Vee! I'm so happy you're okay!
Luz: Woah.
Vee: Yeah. Thank you, Camila. For everything.
Camila: Vee. You have a place here for as long as you need. And take these. Luz said they might be helpful for you.
Vee: Magic!
Luz: Mom, you were awesome back there! Thanks for being cool... about everything.
Camila: I'm trying to hold it together... I really am... But I have never been this scared before. A demon realm? Magic? How are you gonna get back here? Is this the only way I can touch you?
Luz: I... I need a little more time, but if I keep working my hardest I will make a working portal, I promise!
Camila: As scary as this is, it really does seem like you've matured.
Luz: Yes! I've learned so much... Staying here was the best decision I ever made.
Camila: You... chose to stay there?
Luz: Oh, uh...
Camila: Were you trying to live out some witch fantasy? Did you... did you hate living with me that much? 
Luz: Mama, no!
Luz: No. Not yet. Not... yet! Mom!
Luz: I'm being pulled back!
Camila: Baby? No, no, no, no, no, no... When you come home, promise you'll stay here. I didn't mean to push you away. I swear things will be different.
Luz: Mom, it's not you, it never was!
Camila: Promise me, Luz... please!
Luz: Okay, Mom. I promise. 
Luz: Mom! 
Eda: And pull, and pull, and...
King, Eda, Hooty: Luz! 
Eda: I'm sorry, I had to pull you out. The portal was closing.
King: Did you talk to your mom? Did you mention me?
Luz: Yeah. Mama... Mom can't wait to meet you guys.
Eda: Well, just rest up now, okay? And don't you worry, kiddo. With everything we've learned, we'll have a real working portal in no time.
King: I'm gonna eat human snacks!
Hooty: I can't wait to share parenting tips!
Eda: Who dubbed you a parent?
