Luz: So they said I couldn't remove my thumb, but look at that! Whoop!
Gus: You sliced it off! You sliced off your own thumb!
Willow: You make doing homework actually fun.
Luz: And they say humans can't do magic.
King: Luz... Nyeh! You've been talking to them all morning. Don't forget about the Luz and King comedy hour!
Eda: Please, no. Not the comedy hour...
King: This week I've been working with props! Oh dear, I've gotten a tube stuck on my nose! Will I ever eat again? Looks like I'm toast!
Eda: It just goes on like this for an hour!
Luz: Heyo, dough boy, quit loafing around!
King: Why don't you bake me?
Luz: School time! See you guys in class!
Willow: Bye!
Gus: But what about the thumb?!
Luz: Hey, don't worry. We'll finish our comedy hour when I get home. 
King: Hee hee, oh, you!
Luz: Try not to miss me while I'm gone! 
King: You... you really think she's coming back this time?
Eda: Yes, she'll be back; she always comes back. It's cute you miss her, though.
King: The King of Demons— The King of Demons misses nobody! I wouldn't care if she came through this door right now! Wha!
Eda: Hey, you're—
King: You're back! I didn't miss you at all.
Luz: Apparently there's an infestation of pixies at Hexside, so school's been canceled.
King: That sounds like a crumby situation.
Hooty: Hey! Guess what's been in my mouth that I'm about to throw up!
Hooty: The mail!
Eda: Junk, junk, death hex.
Eda: Oh, a carnival's in town today!
Luz: A carnival? You know, I've been so busy with school lately, what do you say we take this comedy hour on tour? It'll be a Luz and King day!
King: That's my kinda day!
Luz: Let's all three of us go!
Hooty: An adventure with friends! I'll go pack my stuff!
Eda: Carnivals bring crowds and crowds bring suckers. This could be the perfect chance to try out my new get-witch-quick scheme. I'm in! To the carnival!
Luz and King: To the carnival!
Hooty: Good news, I'm bringing my knapsack full of games! Hello?
Hooty: Oh, a fly! Talk to me, talk to me!
Eda: Well, here we are, kids. Look at all that fresh meat.
Luz: And smell all the fresh meat! Fun!
Eda: No games for you, Owlbert, we've got scams to run.
Tibbles: Friends! Welcome!
Tibbles: I see you got my postcard.
Eda: Tibbles? You sent this?
Tibbles: Mm-hmm.
Luz: Aren't you mad at us for destroying your stand?
King: Ooh, and destroying his life! That was the best part!
Tibbles: No, no, no. I should thank you. After my stand was destroyed, I reevaluated my life and found my true calling! I'm now ringmaster of... Tibbles's Tent of Tiny Terrors!
Luz: Aww. It's like a regular circus but adorably small!
Luz: You're my friends now.
Eda: I don't buy it. What kind of con are you running?
Tibbles: No cons here, Owl Lady, only pros. In fact, why don't we toast our newfound friendship with this totally innocent bottle of water. 
Eda: Oh yeah, sure! Why don't I just—
Oracle Teacher: I'm okay!
Eda: I know poison when I see it; you can't scam a scammer! Now speaking of scams... Beat it loser! Step right up to... Eda's Human Horror House! Humans shed their skin and I've got proof. 
King: You should really put a lock on your closet.
Luz: You know what, Eda can pick through my socks all she wants. Because today is all about having a great time with my partner in crime.
King: That's me! I love crime!
Tibbles: Have a good time, friends. While it lasts.
Abomination Student: Dunk the skeleton! Win a prize!
Skeleton: Ah! Aah! I'm covered in pores!
Luz: Now this is my kind of weird! So what do you wanna do first? We could brave the molar coaster, or eat a mysterious blob...
King: Ooh, what's that? Ah! Some kind of deadly string weapon.
Luz: No, silly. That's a friendship bracelet.
King: Is that a type of deadly weapon?
Luz: A weapon of love. It's basically a declaration to the whole world that you're the best of friends.
King: Ooh! That's way safer than becoming blood brothers! Luz, we must have those bracelets!
Prize Vendor: And yoink. Sorry, ma'am. If your bone son wants these bracelets you'll have to play the games and win the tickets. You know, carnival rules.
King: Beat up the man and steal his things for me.
Luz: Or let's just play the games.
King: Oh, okay.
Luz and King: Games! Games! Games! Games!
Luz: Friends!
Willow: Luz!
Gus: Hey, Luz!
Luz: Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd see carniv-y'all here.
Gus: Boo.
Willow: I got an invitation from Tibbles.
Gus: We figured it's a trap since we squashed his stand with a walking house.
Willow: But who cares? This place has a Scarris wheel.
Gus: It's like a human Ferris wheel but it gives you long-lasting nightmares.
Luz: Yes! This mama is ready for trauma.
King: Ahem.
Luz: Oh, yeah. We're on a very important quest to win a special prize for King.
Willow: Oh! We can help with that.
Gus: Aw. Does the little guy wanna win a prize? Uh, does he? Uh, does he? 
King: Nyeh! 
Luz: What do you think, King? The more the merrier, huh?
King: Um, sure. Whatever you want, Luz.
Luz: All right. Approval!
Willow: So the pixie infestation was actually caused when Boscha's pet pixie escaped its cage...
Luz: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
King: Curse these stubby legs!
Tibbles: Oh, my, my, my. You seem troubled.
King: Weh? Who said that?
Tibbles: It is I. Obvioso, the all-seeing psychic.
King: Haven't I seen you somewhere? It's almost so...
Tibbles: Obvious?
King: That's what I was gonna say. Wow! You really are psychic.
Tibbles: You're right. And Obvioso can see that something is bothering you, little friend.
King: You got my number, Obvioso. Today was supposed to be about me and Luz, see? But now she's distracted by her cool new school friends.
Tibbles: What if I were to tell you that there was a way to make all those problems... disappear?
King: I'd say that sounds illegal. I would also say go on.
Tibbles: Behold!
King: Holy bones! You poofed it. Call the cops! This guy's crazy!
Tibbles: Hey. The spray is only temporary. I just give my cheeks a tap and then...
Tibbles: ...it returns safe and sound.
Tibbles: Take this. Enjoy the carnival without the problems. Luz, Willow, and Gus will be none the wiser.
King: Whoa! You even know their names. Guess there's no use arguing with a fortune-teller. Thanks, Obvioso. 
King: Hey.
King: Side note: in the future, do I ever find love?
Tibbles: Uh... yes?
King: Hmm, maybe I should think about this first.
Luz: King!
Luz: Sorry we lost you back there, little dude.
King: Hey, it's okay. Let's go back to the games and win those bracelets.
Gus: But we haven't gone on any rides and there's no line for the bumper carcasses.
King: Games!
Gus: Carcasses!
King: Games!
Gus: Carcasses!
Luz: Food! I'm gonna crab some rotten candy while you guys figure this out. Bye!
Willow: When Luz comes back let's go on the three-man cauldron spinner.
Gus: Or the triple swing.
Willow: Oh, and that's close to those photo booths that can fit exactly three people.
King: But today was me and Luz's day.
Gus: Aw. Does the little baby boo miss his buddy Luz? 
Gus: Uh, does he? Uh, does he?
King: The King of Demons misses nobody.
King: I demand you put me down!
Willow and Gus: What?
King: Oh, no! What have I done?
Luz: Wow. I guess they really wanted to ride those bumper carcasses.
King: Actually, Luz. There's something I gotta tell you.
Luz: No. There's something I gotta tell you, King. I said I'd help you win those friendship bracelets. So win them we shall, okay?
King: Uh... Willow and Gus will be okay for a little while, right?
Luz: What was that?
King: Nothing. Now let's go! 
Luz: Ready or not, here we crumb.
King: Yes! Ha ha!
Gus: First, I'm growing out of my clothes. Now I'm shrinking? Dang, puberty. You're the craziest coaster of 'em all.
Willow: Ugh.
Gus: What happened to us? Did I blackout on the molar coaster again?
Willow: Sketchy carnival rides are not to blame this time. King had something in his pouch that made us small.
Gus: And I just got tall enough for the rides! 
Willow: Gus...
Gus: Ah!
Gus: I think we're safe now.
Gus: Ew! 
Willow: Enough of this!
Willow: Quick! We have to find Luz and get her attention before any more carnival animals hunt us down.
Willow: Eat up, my stead. Lead us to safety. 
Gus: It's so hairy. Why is it so hairy?
Willow: Because up close, everything is hairy. 
Eda: Round as the moon, her ears are, with mood swings as terrifying as night itself. Now, who wants to touch an outdated human reference? 
Citizen #1: I do.
Citizen #2: Me.
Clown Guard: Okay, show's over. This witch doesn't have a license.
Citizen #2: I can't do time again!
Citizen #1: Run!
Eda: Ah, what are you? The fun police?
Clown Guard: Yes! And you're coming with me. 
Eda: Uh, excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with your staff. Owlbert! Owlbert! Where are you?
Eda: Owlbert, you're lucky I can't be mad at your adorable antics.
Candy Vendor: Hey, I caught her.
Eda: I hate carnivals.
Gus: We can't keep doing this.
Willow: We won't have to for much longer.
Eda: Just when I thought I couldn't respect the law any less...
Eda: ...it surprises me.
Carnival Boss: So, I hear you're running scams at my carnival? That's my job. And I take my job very seriously. 
Eda: Spare me the yuks. What do you want?
Carnival Boss: Since I'm a forgiving demon, I'll give you two options. I can pass you along to the Emperor's Coven, who'll throw you in the Conformatorium, or you can scam for me.
Prize Vendor: 1230... 1231...
Luz: Now, King, before you spend your tickets are you sure you want those friendship bracelets and not this bad boy?
Cursed Skull: I am the King of Night. And every breath you take brings you closer to darkness.
Luz: This guy's a riot.
King: Yes, Luz. I want the bracelets. It's kind of important to me, okay?
Cursed Skull: I can be important to you. I, who have seen the birth and death of countless nations—
Prize Vendor: Hey, stop it.
Prize Vendor: No, no. Stop it. Yes, where was I, uh... Well, lost count. Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six...
Luz: Ugh, gross. I'm gonna need a mirror. I'll be right back, King. 
Prize Vendor: 12, 13, 14...
King: Count faster.
Luz: Oh. There we go.
Luz: "You made it". Aw. What a supportive sign. Wait a sec.
Luz: Supportive friends!
Willow: Wait, Luz, don't do it!
Luz: Huh?
Luz: Oh, my gosh.
Prize Vendor: One million. Yep, I just counted to one million. The bracelets are yours. 
King: Yes. Yes! Now Luz and I will share a bond as mighty as these trinkets! 
King: Heya, Luz. Good news. I got the bracelets.
Luz: King...
King: Huh?
Willow: You splashed us with something to make us small.
Gus: And now I can't go on the big boy rides! You monster.
King: Y-you weren't supposed to shrink. You, you were supposed to disappear. Ooh, no. Wait.
Luz: What?
King: No, no, no. Luz, I can explain. I wanted to win the bracelets and there was this psychic, see? 
Luz: That must've been what did it. Give me the spray bottle, King.
King: No, wait I-I-I gotta explain.
Luz: There's nothing to explain. 
King: I was just trying to...
Luz: Shrink my friends?
King: I was just trying to solve my problems.
Luz and King: Uh-oh.
Willow and Gus: Hi.
King: Wait, I can fix it. Obvioso showed me how. Behold. Why isn't this working?
Tibbles: I'd say it's working quite well.
Gus: Um, Luz, I think King is broken.
King: Tapping my cheeks is supposed to turn us normal. The psychic told me.
Tibbles: Oh, did he? But, what if he... lied to you from the start? Hold on. Lied to you from the start? It's different.
King: You fiend. When Obvioso finds out you stole his mustache... Oh...
Tibbles: The potion was designed by me. Guess whose cheeks control it?
Luz: Why are you doing this?
Tibbles: When you destroyed my stand, you destroyed generations of Grimm Hammer history. Now it's time to pay.
All: Oof!
Tibbles: Welcome to the greatest show on the Boiling Isles!
Tibbles: Will these witches and demon survive feeding time? Let's find out!
Luz: Aw. At least he's still my friend.
Luz: That's how friends react.
Tibbles: You ruined my livelihood. So now, you'll feed my livelihood.
Tibbles: Place your bets and enjoy the show!
Gus: Well, if I have to go, at least I'm with my best friends. And King.
Eda: Caramel Crab Apples. Get 'em hot and pinchy.
Man: Hey, over here!
Eda: Yeah, yeah. Hold your spider-horses.
Luz: We've gotta—
Luz: —find a way out of here!
King: Ah, King, you idiot. This is all your fault. But I think I know how to fix it.
Luz: King?
King: Willow, Gus, I'm sorry for poofing you. And Luz, I'm sorry for taking away your friends.
King: I know you'll eventually go home and now you're spending more time at school. I just... wanna be around you!
Student #1: No!
Student #2: Boo! Boo!
Tibbles: No refunds.
King: Alright. I only have one shot. Nyah!
Tibbles: Darn flies. Oh, no.
Eda: Hey, hey. No discounts, buddy.
Man: You guys owe me. There's nothing happening in this show.
Man #2: Not a single one of those dumb kids have gotten hurt yet.
Eda: Dumb kids? Wait. Those are my dumb kids!
Luz: You shrunk the animals too?
Tibbles: It's the Tent of Tiny Terrors. Something needed to be tiny.
Man: Finish the job! Get them kids.
Student #3: Feast!
Tibbles: They... foiled my plans! You will pay for this! This time I'm gonna personally squash you!
Eda: Oh, no, Tibbles. That's not how entertainment works. The bad guy always gets his just desserts. 
Tibbles: Oh, no! Not desserts!
Eda: Hey, girls. This one's on the house.
Willow: Looks like we ruined his life for a second time.
Gus: We're on a roll.
King: Gus, Willow, you're okay!
Luz: All thanks to you, King. Here. It was all that was left.
King: It's... it's okay. Because now there's a piece for everybody. If you'll accept it, that is?
Willow: Thank you, King.
Gus: Yeah. I've always wanted to own a jagged piece of cheap metal.
Luz: That's very sweet.
King: I'm sorry, Luz. Demons do crazy things when they've been missing somebody.
Luz: And can I tell you a secret? I've been missing you too. 
King: Hey, we still have a few hours of carnival left. Wanna hit those bumper carcasses?
Luz: You bread my mind.
King: Yes! Bread puns! Bread puns forever! 
Luz: You coming, Eda?
Eda: Nah. I think I got everything I wanted.
Eda: Yep. Another great year at the carnival.
Hooty: Boy, fly, we sure get into some wacky hijinks, don't we?
Hooty: Sure feel sorry for anyone that missed seeing us two rabble-rousers getting into scrapes.
Hooty: Good thing I brought a camera. Yep. Hooty and fly. Together forever. You and me. Every single day— Now I know what friendship taste like. Yum. Taste like a bug.
