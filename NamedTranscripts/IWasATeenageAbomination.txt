Eda: Well, Luz! Did you ever in your life think you'd see something as breathtaking as this?
Luz: I don't like this. 
Eda: Yes, it doesn't get much more inspiring than the trash slug. It makes a home, a life from what others have thrown by the wayside. Until, blam, it gets blasted by a wave one day and croaks from all the salt. And then we get to sell the stuff it ate. 
Luz: Please don't make me.
King: Aw, come on, Luz. It's not every day you get to go to the dump and pick apart a garbage carcass.
Eda: Ah, nuts to you both.
Luz: So, Eda...
Luz: What if we tried some new lessons for my apprenticeship? Like...
Luz: Read ancient scrolls or mix together potions, or—
Eda: Ugh. That sounds like a bunch of magic school stuff.
Luz: Wait. Is there a magic school here? Like, winding towers, cute uniforms, dark plots that threaten your life kind of magic school?
Eda: Mm-hmm. What's worse, they force you to learn magic the "proper" way. But magic isn't proper. It's wild and unpredictable. And that's why it's so beautiful. I didn't finish school, and look at me! Who wouldn't envy where I am right now?
Eda: Uh... Hey, here's a lesson. A great witch is resourceful, like this.
Luz: Oh, hey. Greasy slime ball.
Eda: Use your slime ball wisely, young witch. Back at it! We'll hit the stink nodes first.
Luz: Actually, if it's okay, I think I'll head home and look at pictures of animals that are still... alive. Love you, King. 
Luz: You little beach peach. 
Eda: More for me, then.
Eda: There we go. Okay.
King: Ow! 
Eda: This is awesome!
Luz: Ugh! If magic's all about digging for slime balls, maybe I don't have the stomach for it. 
Girl: You can do it! You can!
Luz: Mysterious voice of encouragement? No! Little witch girl.
Girl: You can do it. Even if you get a bad grade, it's not a reflection of you as a witch. And my parents are right. There are better opportunities on this track. Now, get to school! Oh, no! Oh, little friend! I'm sorry!
Mean Girl: Willow! Wow. You're so unnoticeable I almost rolled into ya. 
Willow: Hi, Amity. 
Amity: Uh, shouldn't you get to class early to prep your...
Amity: Oh, Willow. You don't have anything to show, do you?
Luz: Witch drama!
Amity: This is why people call you "Half-a-Witch Willow."
Amity: Oh, looks like someone wants to say something to you. Abomination, rise.
Abomination: You're a... star.
Amity: Aw. It's like mine. But much smaller and meaningless. As top student, it's my duty to tell you to keep at it. Even you could get a passing grade someday. Abomination, cower.
Amity: See you in class, superstar.
Willow: "Oh, see you in class, superstar!" I hate when she does that.
Willow: I hate making abominations. I hate getting bad grades. Ugh! I can't stand this anymore. 
Eda: Not a bad haul. That oviduct was loaded.
King: Ah. Lose apprentice, gain garbage eggs. Fair trade.
Eda: I didn't lose anything.
King: If you don't teach Luz right, you will. And that's when I come in, make her my apprentice.
Eda: Ha! And what would you teach? How to get stuck in the arm of a sweater?
King: Hey, that only happened once! I'd teach her about demons. How to identify them, talk to 'em, raise an army with them and tear apart the world!
Eda: After they tear you out of the sweater arm, right?
King: You think you're so smart! Well, why don't we make a little bet where I can prove that I'd make a better teacher.
Eda: Okay. I'm obligated to remind you that I only use our bets to utterly humiliate you. And... that you've never won.
King: I like those odds.
Eda: So how's this? Teach this trash slug to be your loyal soldier in one day. Prove that you can be a better teacher than me, and Luz is all yours. But if you don't, I change your name from King to... Mr. Wiggles.
King: Well, when you lose, you'll have to... wear a shame hat and sleep in a shack and never come into the Owl House again! Ha!
Eda: Deal.
Eda: Ha ha!
Willow: Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I'm so sorry! 
Luz: It's okay. The thorns only went through a few layers of skin.
Willow: So... circly.
Willow: You're human! This is astounding! A human on the Boiling Isles! How'd you get here? What are you doing here?
Willow: Uh, I'm sorry. I can't stay. I have to go disappoint my teacher. It was nice to meet you, human. 
Luz: Wait! I'm Luz. And you're Willow, right? What you did with that flower and those plants, it was... wow.
Willow: Thanks, but... I'm not even supposed to be doing plant magic. My parents put me in the abomination track at school.
Luz: Like, magic school?
Luz: That's so cool! I'm so jealous. I have a teacher, but her lessons are a bit... untraditional. I bet she wouldn't even let me enroll. But I wish I could spend one day there.
Willow: I wish I could get a passing grade for once. Then people would stop calling me "Half-a-Witch Willow."
Luz: Hey, wait. I know how we can both get what we want. Make me your abomination. I'll get you a good grade, and you can get me into magic school. It's fiendishly clever.
Willow: What?
Luz: I saw that girl's thing. It's just chunks of stuff that talks weird. I'm chunks of stuff, and I talk weird!
Willow: That's true. Okay. It's a deal. Luz.
Luz: This is a great plan.
Willow: Oops. Abomination goo.
Luz: Great plan.
Willow: Welcome to Hexside School of Magic and Demonics. Remember to stay hidden, okay?
Willow: Hmm?
Boy: Willow, you would not believe humans.
Willow: Humans? Psh. I haven't seen any. What?
Boy: Did you know that humans nail barbed wire to their kids' teeth? But why? Maybe to make them magnetic.
Luz: Actually, it's for storing treats.
Willow: Okay, Augustus. I'm gonna tell you something. But you have to be cool.
Augustus: I can be spool. I mean, cool.
Willow: Okay. Abomination, rise.
Luz: Ta-da! I'm an abomination.
Willow: Luz, that's not how abominations act.
Augustus: No. No, it— it couldn't be.
Willow: He's the president of the Human Appreciation Society. Most witches wouldn't be able to recognize a human right away. But Augustus is an expert.
Augustus: Where are your gills?
Luz: I knew an Augustus back in the human world. We called him Gus.
Augustus (Gus): Gus? Nickname? Human nickname? Gus? Call me it. Wow. Gus. This is the best day of my life.
Gus: I've gotta get to spelling class. See you guys at lunch!
Willow: All right. Into the darkness you go.
King: Aw. Who's a good Prince, Jr.? Who's a good guy?
Eda: Hey, Mr. Wiggles. You're not gonna teach it anything doing that.
King: It's called positive reinforcement, Eda. And it works wonders.
King: Ha ha! See? Now watch this. Prince, Jr.! Attack Eda! Knock over her drink! Mess up her hair!
Eda: Oh, no. Please stop.
King: Well, I haven't seen your student in forever. For all we know, she's not even loyal to you anymore.
Eda: Ha-ha-ha, you wish. But yeah. Where is she?
Male student: Hope I pass.
Female student: I'm confident about this.
Professor Hermonculus: Hmm. Too many toenails in unexpected places. Fail. Pathetic!
Professor Hermonculus: The biggest abominations are all of you! If the next abomination is a failure, everyone gets extra homework for a month!
Male student: Extra homework? Not again!
Professor Hermonculus: And the next one to come up is...
Amity: Excuse me, sir, but I am ready to present my abomination. Rise!
Professor Hermonculus: I've always saved the best for last, Amity. You'll have to wait your turn. How about... Willow.
Male student: Not Half-a-Witch.
Female student: Great. Homework for a month.
Luz: Don't listen to them, Willow. We can do this.
Willow: Uh... Abomination, rise.
Luz: Ta-da!
Willow: Abomination, bow.
Luz: Blah!
Professor Hermonculus: Very impressive. But does it speak?
Luz: Uh, I may be your abomination, but you're my a-mom-ination.
Students: Aw!
Professor Hermonculus: "A-mom-ination!" Splendid wordplay. A plus!
Professor Hermonculus: Wonderful work today, Willow. Looks like we have a new top student.
Amity: But...
Willow: Uh—Thank you, sir.
Amity: Hey.
Amity: Last time I saw you, your abomination was mush. What did you do?
Willow: I, uh, took your pep talk to heart, Amity.
Amity: I bet you did. I've got my eyes on you, Half-a-Witch. That badge is mine. 
Student: Hey!
Willow: Uh-oh. I think Amity is onto us.
Hooty: Ow!
Eda: Have you seen Luz?
Hooty: I heard her tiny mouse feet walking close by. Or that might've been some mice. Anyway, someone started moving in that direction. Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo.
Eda: Are you trying to point, or—?
Hooty: Look at the weather vane!
Eda: But the only thing that way is the... No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Teacher #1: Okay, everyone. Recite your runes.
Kids: Krom, Zix, Elgrim, Zenomide—
Eda: No. Blind obedience.
Teacher #2: Heximal system time! Let's get memorizin'!
Eda: No! Pointless busywork!
Eda: No! Why! School!
Gus: Hey. Do humans eat PB&J's?
Luz: Oh my gosh, I haven't eaten real food in so long, please give me some.
Willow: I don't know, Gus. If Amity saw that...
Amity: I saw that! Abominations don't eat! I know you're in there! You can't hide from me. What are you? Who are you? I want answers! 
Professor Hermonculus: Amity Blight.
Amity: Huh?
Professor Hermonculus: I suspected a twinge of jealousy, but this, this is just sad.
Amity: But I—No! Look at it.
Professor Hermonculus: Report to Principal Bump's office.
Amity: But—
Professor Hermonculus: Now!
King: Roll over! Yes! Heel!
King: Yes, yes!
King: So, did you find your runaway student? By your expression, I can tell Luz has gone and found herself someplace else to learn. Which means I have won!
Eda: Yes, great, you won.
Eda: You have a giant soldier thing and I have nothing. Congrats!
King: Oh, Eda. Don't say that. At least you have this! 
Eda: Ugh. 
King: I am so funny! Ah, well, Prince, Jr. training complete. Go forth! Make the world tremble at your feet—or worm stubs.
King: Go forth?
King: Oh. Right.
King: Ah!
Luz: Whoo! I'm a sweaty little abomination. But now we don't have to worry about Amity. High five!
Luz: Slap my hand. It's a human thing.
Gus: Oh. Oh, my. Oh, man, what a rush!
Principal Bump: Good afternoon, students.
Willow: Principal Bump.
Principal Bump: Hmm. Abomination, rise.
Principal Bump: Abomination, lie.
Luz: Uh, viral fame is a worthy pursuit. Your cat would never eat you if it got the chance. Chemtrails are real—
Principal Bump: Oh, no, abomination. How strange for it to get the command wrong. I mean lie down. 
Principal Bump: So very lifelike. When Miss Blight told me about your abomination, I had to come by, see what she's made of.
Willow: Oh, I have her list of ingredients right here.
Principal Bump: No. We were hoping... for a closer look. Willow, I'll allow you the first cut.
Willow: Uh, you can't just cut open a human, can you?
Principal Bump: Willow, go ahead and make the first incision.
Gus: Wait, Principal Bump! Uh, high five!
Gus: Run!
Amity: They're getting away!
Principal Bump: No, the intruder won't get far.
Luz: This is all my fault, Willow. I just wanted to see what a real magic school was like.
Willow: Well, how do you like it?
Luz: It's lovely, actually.
Willow: Okay, we should get out of here before—
Willow: ...Bump seals us in.
King: Help me, help me, help me!
Eda: Trouble with your student?
King: Yes, yes!
Eda: Are you sure you need my help? Maybe he only wants more of your brilliant lessons.
King: Please help me! You can call me Mr. Wiggles!
Eda: Okay, Mr. Wiggles. Here's what we're gonna do.
Willow: Oh, this is awful. I don't know what to do. Amity's right. I'm just Half-a-Witch Willow.
Luz: You're Full-Witch Willow. And you're great. And someone once told me great witches are resourceful. 
Willow: That's it! 
Luz: You mean that greasy slime ball?
Willow: Luz, it's a seed! Thank goodness you had it on you.
Luz: Yeah. Thank goodness someone told me to hold on to it.
Willow: Please grow!
Principal Bump: Remarkable.
Luz: There's the exit!
Amity: Not so fast!
Amity: I'm not letting you get away so easily. I want my badge! Abominations, seize!
Luz: Whoa!
Willow: Get outta here!
Luz: No! I'm not leaving you.
Willow: I may get detention, but you'll get dissected.
Willow: So go!
Luz: Willow! I can't save you right now. But I know someone who can! 
Eda: Pour the salt, now!
King: Baby boy!
King: I have no son. Eat salt!
King: Yes, I did it! I'm amazing! Ahh!
King: You helped too. You are a good teacher.
Eda: I wish Luz thought that too.
Luz: Eda!
Eda: Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is this? Ugh! I never understand when you do this.
Luz: Your lesson worked! Keeping junk in my pocket saved my life! But wait. My new friends. They're in danger.
Willow: Luz!
Eda: Seriously, what is that?
Willow: You won't believe it, Luz. Everything is perfect now!
Luz: It's true. I don't believe it.
Willow: Principal Bump was so impressed by my plant work he's switching me to the plant magic track! Look!
Luz: Yes!
Luz: Whoo! Oh. What about Amity?
Gus: Last we saw, she was asking Bump if today could count as extra credit.
Luz: Well, I can't wait to see you in action next time I sneak in. 
Gus: Uh, about that. You're kinda, sorta... banned.
Eda: That's my girl!
Willow: But we could come here and teach you what we learned.
Luz: Aw. That would be nice. But... I have a pretty great teacher already.
Eda: Yeah, that's right. Luz is my student. Back off, academy twerps.
Eda: Ah, baby's first wanted poster. Good job, kid. Looks like I taught you something after all.
Gus: Uh, you high five with your hands, not your head.
