King: Partake of my free snack samples! Take them; I demand it as your ruler, the King of Demons!
King: Nyeh! Why isn't anyone paying attention to me? I'm their rightful overlord. Intellectually and such.
Eda: Yeah... hey! It reeks more of nerd than money today.
Luz: Guys!
Passerby: Ah!
Luz: You will not believe what's going on! It's a book fair! Where books come to life!
Book: Hello.
King: A fair without rides?
Boy: Who needs rides when this can take you anywhere?
King: Nyeh.
Eda: A, ew. B, I'm bored. C, I feel like pickpocketing some dork while they browse. 
Luz: No, wait! Will you give it a chance? I'll let you ride in my hoodie! 
King: Ooohoohoohoo!
Luz: This book fair's got everything! A zine-making workshop, meet and greets, and—what's that? A writing competition!? I've always wanted to be a writer.
King: Writer? What? I thought you wanted to be a witch?
Luz: Of course I wanna be a witch. But where I'm from that's kinda... impossible. So my runner up dream was to be a writer. I've had this about the author picture since I was seven years old. I know my good angle. I'm gonna enter the competition.
King: Ugh! What are these basement dwellers doing out in natural sunlight?
Tinella Nosa: Um! We're in line for Jon De Plume, most famous writer on the Boiling Isles, famed author of the Realm Warriors series! I'm gonna have him read my story... and marry me.
Man: Jon, will you sign my child?
Jon: I'll sign anything! 
King: Such power. Such command he holds over his minions. I must have the same! Luz the human! I too shall enter the competition.
Luz: Really? We could work together! It'll be perfect! We're best friends, so we'll make the best team!
King: Team! Yes!
King: My name goes first on the cover.
Eda: Boring, boring. Boring. Another wrinkle! The curse is quickening!
Lilith: You, lackey.
Eda: Lilith...
Lilith: Do you have the item we discussed?
Merchant: Oh! Yes, right here. 
Lilith: This is excellent. A map to the Bloom of Eternal Youth. I think the emperor will be very pleased.
Steve: Ma'am, shouldn't we be searching for the Owl Lady to join the coven? Remember that whole plan.
Lilith: My sister's curse has left her frail. She'll still be here when we get back.
Lilith: This comes first, it's for the emperor after all.
Steve: Yeah! All hail the emperor!
Lilith: Very good, Steve! 
Steve: Shoulder pats for Steve! 
Eda: Hey bub, what'd you sell my prissy sister?
Merchant: Oh! It's a map to the Bloom of Eternal Youth. A rare flower that only grows once a millennia. Like the name says, it gives eternal youth to whomever holds it.
Eda: Interesting. So Lilith wants to nab this power for the emperor, huh. Well, won't she be surprised when I get there first and get it for myself! Hah! That'll show her who's frail.
Merchant: Well, we'll see won't we. Can't go without a map of course.
Luz: Now, let's write down some ideas that we want to see in the story.
King: I can write anything?
Luz: Yeah! We're brainstorming, every idea is a good idea.
King: Mhm! Done! 
Luz: Aw, is that all you want to see?
Luz: Hmm.
Luz: Romance! Magic! Heartbreak with shimmer tears. And, the main character is, of course, ahhh, Luzura! I know it's kind of cliché, but what's wrong with cliché?
King: Nyeh! And my main character is the King... err... the Ruler of Demons! With this totally original, all-star cast, victory will be ours!
Luz: Now for the easy part.
King: "Luzura's tears fell on the frozen prince, bringing him back to life." Ehhh, it just seems kind of unrealistic.
Luz: I see what you're saying. But in your version, Ruler just destroys everything. I think a little romantic tension could help the scene.
King: Hey, there's more to life than shipping.
Luz: Don't you dare insult shipping in my presence!
Eda: Apprentice! Living room!
Luz: I'll be back, we'll figure this out, okay writing buddy? 
King: My turn to write!
Luz: Hey!
Luz: What's up, boss lady?
Eda: I am popping out for a few days to an undisclosed place to do undisclosed things. You're in charge.
Luz: Great!
Eda: No questions!
Luz: Okay!
Eda: I said no questions! 
Luz: Well, King, it's just you and me for a while. 
King: Hey hey Luz, great news!
Luz: What have you done?!
King: I just made a few tiny edits and this baby is humming!
Luz: Luzura dies?
King: I know, right! What a twist!
Luz: King, I know you're trying to help, but I think you're crossing a line.
King: Yeah, into greatness. Don't you want us to win?
Luz: If this is how you want to win, maybe you should submit the story on your own. 
King: What?
King: Bah! What does she know?
Typewriter: What the heck, man? Learn to collaborate.
King: Hush, you! I'll prove to both of you my story is superior.
King: Hey, you scum! Which one of you wants to read my literary masterpiece? Anyone brave enough?
King: Oof!
King: Nyah! Ugh.
Piniet: I'll read your story. You wrote this?
King: Yup, that's me! Only me.
Piniet: Let me get you a fruit punch.
King: Ooh. I love punching.
Piniet: I'm Piniet, of Piniet Publishing House. And your name is... King?
King: It's more of a rank than a name.
Piniet: I loved your story, so much better than the submissions we got for the competition. I want to buy it and publish it for everyone to read. I'll make you as famous as Jon De Plume.
King: I've always wanted a people chair! I'm in! This will be my first step in my reclamation of power!
Piniet: Then all you have to do is sign here.
King: You're ominous. And I like it.
Piniet: Get ready to be famous, Mr. King.
Welcome Mat: Ouch! Jeez.
Reviewnicorn: It's the perfect blend of heart and heartlessness! Like two authors mashed into one! 
King Cardboard Cutout: Spend money on my thing I wrote. Spend money on my thing I wrote.
Crowd: Oh my God! it's the King, I can't believe it!
Tinella Nosa: Mr. King! I love your writing. Please read my story!
King: Oh my, always good to meet minions. I mean fans. 
Tinella Nosa: You're my inspiration.
Eda: Okay, from the Minitaur, I head due north, and with luck, I'll get to the Bloom of Eternal Youth before Lilith! Who's frail now, emperor dorks?
Eda: Someone's following me.
Eda: Spicy toss!
Lilith: Aah!
Eda: Lilly?
Lilith: Edalyn?
Lilith: And of course you would be here just to be a nuisance. Why don't you go home and rest? Wouldn't want you breaking a hip.
Eda: Sorry, sister, I'm stronger than you think. I'm here to save the Bloom of Eternal Youth from the likes of you. And I'm gonna get there before you!
Lilith: Aah! No you won't!
King: Hey, Luz!
King: Guess who won the writing competition and became a blockbuster writer superstar?
King: You're right, it's me! Me! Do you wanna touch my scarf? A fan crocheted it out of their own hair! It smells so bad!
King: My publisher is throwing a huge party for my book, Ruler's Reach. And I, uh, I'd like for you to be there
King: Alright, fine! Be that way I guess.
Typewriter: Girl, you don't need him.
Luz: But I don't want to be mad at him, either.
Fan: Your fans are dying to know when Ruler's Reach 2 comes out!
King: That's between me and my publisher, right, Piniet?
Piniet: Yes. Ooh, pardon me, I need a few moments of King's time.
King: Where's Jon De Plume at? I wanted to compare sunglasses.
Piniet: Oh he's taking a break to finish his latest masterpiece. Fame can really box you in, you know? Uh, speaking of, how's your second book coming along?
King: Coming along? Or finished! Bam! Haha! Ruler's Reach 2—now with more swears!
Piniet: Ahhh! Splendid! Oh, you cad! Not only are you a great writer, but a practical joker as well!
King: That's true—wait, what?
Piniet: Oh, this is truly awful! Looking forward to the real draft. 
King: Truly awful? But I'm a best-selling writer. How?
King: Luz! I can't write without her!
King: Luz, buddy! I'm so glad you could make it!
Luz: Hey, King, I didn't wanna be angry at your success. You're my friend. So, congratulations!
King: Great to hear, 'cause I really need your help with my next book!
Luz: Huh?
King: Apparently I can't write my daring works of genius without rebelling against your gushy fantasy slop!
Luz: Excuse me?
King: We make a great team! So, here's a pen. Writey writey, clock's a-tickin'!
Luz: I'm not writing for you after you made fun of all my ideas!
King: Hey! What the heck?
Luz: Congratulations on all your hard earned success. 
King: What am I gonna do? I can't write without her!
Piniet: Hmm...
Eda: Ha! Doesn't this remind you of how we used to race to the kitchen, Lilly? Lilly?
Lilith: Mmm! Mmm!
Eda: Lilly!
Eda: Alley-Oop!
Lilith: Ugh, thank you Edalyn! I wasn't certain that you'd save me.
Eda: Stow it! Ugh, we might fight, but you're still my sister. And besides, if someone's gonna be putting you down, it's gonna be me. Ha! 
Lilith: Is that?
Eda: The Bloom of Eternal Youth! Alright back off, that baby's mine.
Lilith: Why are you always like this?
Eda: Because Lilith, you think I'm just some tired old biddy. Ah, but I'm more than that. And with the Bloom of Eternal Youth's power, I'll show you!
Eda: What the—
Luz: They got his good angle.
Luz: Uh, can I help you?
Piniet: Perhaps. I hear you're an aspiring writer.
Crowd: King! King! King!
Boy: I can't wait for the sequel!
Amelia: If it's disappointing in any way, I will spend every day of my life trashing it!
King: Oh boy. Oh, man, Aw jeez. Hemming. Hawing. Piniet, I gotta come clean. We can't announce book two. I can't write without... without...
Piniet: Without your writing partner?
Luz: King!
King: Luz! 
Luz: That snappily dressed lizard trapped me in this shrinking box.
Luz: You gotta get me out!
King: What are you doing with her? Let her go!
Piniet: You wrote Ruler's Reach together. So if you don't want her crushed, you'll write together again.
Piniet: Oh, don't give me that look. Some of the best books were written in literal crunch time.
Luz: That's a toxic mentality that contributes to burnout and unrealistic expectations! King, do something!
King: Set her free, now!
Piniet: Not until I get my best-seller. You'll recall you are under contract.
King: Ah! Nyeh!
Luz: Ah! 
King: Oof!
Piniet: Make your deadline, or you'll never be able to hold a pen again. Just like...
Jon De Plume: Help me!
King: No!
Author #1: Help us!
Author #2: Get us out of here!
Piniet: I'll leave you to it. Looking forward to your next volume! 
King: We're not getting out of here until we write a book, and that'll take forever! We're cube meat!
Luz: Well, I have my story.
King: But it's all hugging and crying! I can't put my name on that.
Luz: King, that is why we are in here! Because you can't compromise! All I wanted was to write a dumb story with my friend.
King: Luz, you're living your dream. You're becoming a witch. But this celebrity is as close as I'll ever get to my dream. It all went to my head, and I hurt you. I'm sorry.
Luz: Hey, being with you is one of my favorite parts of this dream.
Luz: I have a plan. But we need to work together this time.
King: Just tell me what to do.
Merchant: I know you must be confused. The Bloom of Eternal Youth, dead? What if I told you the Bloom never existed at all! And now that I have led you to my nest, I'll suck all the life out of you to satisfy my unending hunger!
Lilith: He scammed us. Can you believe he scammed us?
Eda: I thought there was a 50/50 chance going in. Hard not to admire the tenacity though.
Lilith: Good entrance, but that outfit? Ha!
Eda: Look at his little shoes! 
Lilith: Stop it.
Merchant: Well, maybe you've never been led into a lethal trap before, but the response should be, "Aa! No! Spare us!"
Eda: Ah, sure. Spare us.
Lilith: Woe to us whose fates are sealed.
Merchant: Tha-That's right, witches! Cower! Cower? 
Piniet: Aw, dang.
King: Hey Piniet! We're done!
Piniet: Faster than I expected!
King: That's the miracle of teamwork!
Piniet: This is much more gushy than your last book.
King: Skip to the finale, because it is quite a payoff.
Piniet: What is this all about?
Luz: Light spell!
Piniet: Ugh!
King: Ugh, I just realized I should've said enlightening. "Skip to the finale, you'll find it enlightening."
Luz: King! The contract!
King: Pretentious scarf, go!
Piniet: I made you a star, and this is how you repay me?
King: No, this is!
Piniet: You are making this harder than it needs to be! And believe me, I am being very patient! But let's...
Piniet: ...cut to the finish.
All: Huh?
Tinella Nosa: King! I am your biggest fan! And I fought my way back here for you... to read my story?
King: I'm sorry, my lawyer advised me not to look at unsolicited work.
Tinella Nosa: But... but... eep!
Piniet: Ugh! If I read this, will you go? So I can annihilate them in peace?
Tinella Nosa: Of course!
Piniet: Oh, it's beautiful! You—You must let me publish this! I can make you a star!
Tinella Nosa: Really?
King: Wait a minute. What about King?
Piniet: Ugh! You're old news. She on the other hand is the future! 
Author #3: Whoo-hoo!
Author #4: Freedom!
King: Hey!
Luz: King! We're good then?
Piniet: Yes, quite.
Tinella Nosa: Pachew, pachew.
Eda: Well, we wrecked this chump. But I guess the Bloom of Eternal Youth isn't real. 
Lilith: Well, if it makes any difference, I don't consider you to be a tired old bitty.
Eda: Really?
Lilith: If you were, you'd be much easier to catch.
Eda: Oh great, you're gonna cart me away to the coven now, are you?
Lilith: Not now. Because I want to give you a chance to join on your own! Join me in the Emperor's Coven, Edalyn. He could even heal your curse.
Eda: No, I'll heal it on my own terms. I don't wanna owe him anything. Catch you later, sis.
Lilith: Not if I catch you first.
Eda: I'll see you around. 
Merchant: You're welcome for the chance to bond.
Eda: Hey, kids. Woof. That was a rough couple days.
Luz: Yeah, I'll say.
Eda: Ah. Well, nothing a bit of apple blood and a good book can't mend.
Luz: Books?
King: Nope, I don't know nothing about that.
Luz: We hate books. Wow, look at the time!
King: What's a book? Good night!
Eda: Huh? What the—
Typewriter: Girl, you do not want to know.
