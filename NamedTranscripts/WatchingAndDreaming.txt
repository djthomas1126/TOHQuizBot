All: Huh?
Hunter: Huh?
Luz: Mama!
Luz: Amity!
Luz: What happened?
Papa Titan: Hey!
Luz: We were— just about to enter the Archives—
Papa Titan: HEY!
Luz: We were just about to rescue Eda and King.
Papa Titan: Luz, the human!
Papa Titan: You have to wake up.
Luz: How did I get here?
Luz: What is this? Is- is this a dream?
Luz: Ow!
Luz: Stringbean, it's you! You sweet, little power noodle. I'm so happy to see you. Are Mama and the others okay?
Luz: Where is everyone?
Luz: No! No, no, no! Wh- When did this happen?
Amity: Don't you remember?
Amity: This is all your doing. You helped Belos meet The Collector. Your actions led to THIS.
Amity: You've been the real villain this whole time!
Luz: Wha- Listen, I- I don't know what I missed, but I'd never do this.
Luz: See?
Amity: I'm sorry, Luz. But I have to take you down.
Luz: Amity, please!
Luz: This isn't a dream. This is a nightmare!
Eda: Huh?
Eda: Lilith? Hooty? King!
Eda: Huh?
Eda: If you think you can keep me from my family, you got another thing comin'!
Lilith: Don't worry, Edalyn. We're all present and accounted for.
Eda: Lily! Ma! Thank goodness. Hey, help me out. We gotta find King.
Lilith: No. You'll be staying right there.
Eda: Huh?
Lilith: Dangerous beasts need to be kept in cages, after all.
Eda: What are you talking about?
Dell: Why, Eda?
Dell: I forgave you.
Bill: Nice, right?
King: Bill! You crazy jerk, how'd I get here?
Bill: I brought you here! I wanted to show you our new collection.
Bill: What's wrong? Don't you recognize your siblings? But don't worry, we saved the best spot for you!
Luz: Trees?
Luz: Willow!
Luz: Oh Willow, I'm so happy to see you. Do you know what's going on? I just saw Amity, and-
Willow: You know, Luz, my life changed after I met you. I finally believed that there was this big, bright future ahead of myself.
Willow: But that didn't last long, did it?
Willow: You destroyed my home and any chance I had at happiness. I have no future now. NONE OF US DO!
Gus: Look, everyone. It's good ol' Luz.
Gus: And she, just might be, the biggest hypocrite ever.
Luz: Wh- what?
Gus: Everyone helped you get back to your mom. Meanwhile, because of you, I'll never see my dad again.
Luz: Gus, no. I- I- I swear, we'll get him back. We'll get everyone back! I won't stop till we do.
Gus: Tell that to HIM!
Hunter: I've always just— followed orders. I never thought about making friends or— going to school. Then I met Flapjack. He was more than a palisman. He was my best friend. And then I lost him, helping you! But you still get to have your own palisman?
Hunter: Why, Luz? Why do you get to have it all?
Amity: I'm sorry. But for the sake of everyone you hurt—
Luz: Please. No.
Amity: —I challenge you to a witch's battle!
Luz: Wait. Say that again.
Amity: I said, I challenge you to a witch's battle!
Luz: A- a witch's battle?
Luz: Bap. Boop.
Luz: You look like Amity.
Luz: You feel like Amity.
Luz: But you're not Amity, are you?
Luz: You're not her! None of you are you!
Willow: How dare you? Of course we're us!
Luz: It's "I challenge you to a witch's duel," not "witch's battle." And the Amity I know would never misquote The Good Witch Azura.
Luz: So come on. Attack me. I know what's going on now. 
Amity: Luz?
Luz: Amity, is that you? Is it really you?
Amity: Yes! We've all been collected, including Camila. The Collector came from the sky, and-
Gus: He's playing games with you, Luz. He's trying to keep you away from King and Eda!
Willow: But if you want to save anyone, you have to wake up!
Luz: How?
Hunter: Think about it. What's the first thing you do when you wake up from a bad dream?
Amity: You turn on the light.
Eda: I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it!
Eda: Huh?
King: Weh? Luz? LUZ!
Luz: Hey, buddy! 
Eda: Is this— real? Is that Luz?
Eda: Are you both really here?
Luz: Get over here, you witch!
The Collector: I thought you said this would work, Rae-Rae. You said, it would make them all "see the error of their ways." But King is gonna hate me for this! Now what do we do?
Belos-Raine: Why bother teaching them anything when you could just— wipe them out?
The Collector: I WANT to be their friends! And besides, my powers don't work on King.
Belos-Raine: The—dog?
The Collector: Yeah! 'Cause he's a Titan!
The Collector: You worked in the castle, Rae-Rae. You've seen the big old heart, still beating too. Titans are AMAZING!
The Collector: When they're full grown, they are more POWERFUL than anyone!
Belos-Raine: You know, I just had an interesting idea.
The Collector: Yeeeeeaaah?
Belos-Raine: No, it wouldn't work.
The Collector: What? What wouldn't work? Tell me, or I'll hold my breath for a million years!
Belos-Raine: Well, if you insist. What if you played with those three yourself? Showed them just how much fun your games are in person? Then they'll ALL want to be your friend.
The Collector: You think?
Belos-Raine: Mm-hmm.
The Collector: ALRIGHT!
The Collector: Wish me luck, Rae-Rae!
Belos-Raine: Perhaps this will be easier than I thought.
Eda: Oh! I thought I'd never see you again! How did you get back to the Demon Realm?
Luz: It's a very long story, I wouldn't know where to begin. There was Belos in the Human Realm—
Eda and King: There was what?
Luz: Then, we saw Kikimora, she uh, was a lot to deal with—
King: I can imagine.
Luz: And then my mom decided to - WOAH, how did that happen?
Eda: Ah, it's a shorter story. Oh! Is that your palisman?
King: Hey, hey, all I wanna do is hear both of you talk over hot chocos milk, but first, we gotta find a way outta, whatever this is!
The Collector: I don't get it, King. I really don't get it. I thought you loved playing our games. Why do you choose these itty bitty spiders over me?
Eda: Because your games stink, squirt!
Luz: And spiders are awesome!
King: Yeah! Especially the itty bitty ones!
The Collector: Ah, you act like I'm doing something bad. But I'm just having fun.
King: Trapping people and scaring them and controlling them? That's not fun, Collector.
Eda: And everyone nearly died from the Draining Spell!
The Collector: So? Toys break all the time, you just fix them.
Luz: Do you... not understand what death means to mortals?
The Collector: Well, don't worry 'cause I don't wanna scare you anymore. I think we can all be great friends. So, let me show you some of my favorite games!
Raine: Ah, let me go!
Belos-Raine: Ugh, Raine's always been annoyingly powerful. No, I think I'll keep you around a little longer.
King: Thank... whoever. I think I barfed, like, twelve times.
Eda: Wanna make it a lucky number thirteen?
King: Eda!
Eda: Luz.
King: Eda, let her go. If anyone can talk some sense into them, it's Luz.
Luz: Collector, you know this can't last forever.
The Collector: Why, 'cause you know you'd lose?
The Collector: I just wanted a friend who wouldn't lie to me, or trick me. But everyone's the same! King lied, Belos lied, even they lied.
Luz: Who's they?
The Collector: The Archivists, my siblings. "Oh, let's play a game", they said. "Let's play hide-and-seek."
The Collector: "You go down there and see if the Titans wanna play!"
The Collector: So I played, and it was great. The baby Titans were the cutest, just like King! And they were all so welcoming! But the Archivists were scared of their power, so one by one, they disappeared, until there was one Titan left. And he thought I was the bad guy. He hid his egg from me and trapped me. 
The Collector: But I showed all of them. Even when those trapper jerks started acting weird. Even when Belos lied to me! I found King! I found the last Titan, and he's my friend now!
King: Collector—
The Collector: I know it's just pretend. I don't care. I'll pretend as long as I want.
Luz: But that's not what you want, is it?
The Collector: What do you know?
Eda: We know what it's like to feel alone.
King: And abandoned—
Luz: And misunderstood. Hey, what if we showed you how we became friends?
The Collector: King already told me about your adventures.
Luz: It's different when you can see them.
Luz: What do you think? Can we tell you our stories?
Raine: I said, GET OUT!
Belos: That's fine. Only one vessel is big enough to do what I need.
Raine: Huh?
Raine: No.
Belos: You know what this is, don't you? It's the last of many, but it still beats.
Belos: It's the Titan's heart!
Belos: Poor Raine. You tried so hard, didn't you?
Raine: 
Amity: Oh my gosh. It worked!
Amity: Miss Lilith?
Gus: Where the heck are we?
Willow: These must be the Archives.
Gus: Camila! Willow, help me get her down.
Amity: Guys, where's Luz?
Luz: Wow, I thought we would just, like, flip through these.
The Collector: So it all started at the birdhouse.
Eda: The Owl House. Speaking of which, what happened to it?
King: You, uh, haven't been here in a while.
Luz: For me, it started in the Human Realm. Things were not great, but I found my way here, and I met Owlbert, Hooty, and Eda the Owl Lady.
King: And the King of Demons!
Luz: None of us felt like we fit in. So we decided to not fit in together.
The Collector: It was that easy, huh?
Luz: Not really—
Luz: I had a lot to learn. But after a little while, I met more people who helped me.
The Collector: Whoa! That game looks fun. I wanna go there!
Luz: This is where we play a game called Grudgby.
King: The ball can bite you, the rules are nonsense, but it's still kinda fun.
Eda: Nonsense? Ha! Hexside lets you play any magic sport these days. Grudgby was all we had and we made the best of it.
Luz: And you were the star player, we know, Eda.
King: Did you know Lilith was their captain?
Luz: Really? Now that's a spinoff I'd watch.
The Collector: Hi, I'm The Collector. Wanna be my Grudgby buddies?
Matt: It's him! Run! Go, go, go, go, go! 
The Collector: I wanna go somewhere different.
Luz: I'm really glad you picked this place, Collector. It's really special to me. It's where Eda helped me make a connection with the Isles.
The Collector: A baby could do that. Still, I've never seen an itty-bitty spider do it that way. Not everyone can recognize Titan magic.
The Collector: He must really like you if he showed you this much. He never told me about it, though.
The Collector: Did you force him to be your friend, too? Like, uh, what are their names— Lilith and Amity?
King: She didn't force anyone to do anything.
Luz: Yeah, people are complex. And sometimes they just need a little kindness and forgiveness.
The Collector: Kindness and forgiveness, huh?
The Collector: Do you hear that?
Luz: Hear what?
The Collector: Breathing.
The Collector: Those eyes—don't tell me it's—
Luz: Belos.
Luz: It's coming from the castle. 
Belos: Finally! I can cleanse this perdition... MYSELF!
Eda: Is that Belos?
Luz: How'd he get here without a body?
King: What do we do? There's no way we can stop that!
The Collector: Yes, there is. And I know how. 
Luz: No, what is he doing?
The Collector: I get it now. You just need kindness and forgiveness, huh?
The Collector: Luz, look! We can all be buddies now!
Luz: Collector! 
King: No!
The Collector: Huh? But I thought I was doing the right thing.
Luz: No, no, you did good, Collector. But this is a little more complicated. Don't worry, I think it... missed... me.
The Collector: Luz? What's happening?
Luz: Eda, King, looks like we're gonna be split up again. I feel like I should be used to this feeling by now, but... I still don't know what to say.
The Collector: Where'd she go?
Amity: What is this?
The Collector: Luz? Luz? Yoo-hoo! You can come out now. Well, it's okay, she just broke, so I'll fix her. What? Why isn't it working? The Archivists aren't here, they couldn't have taken her.
The Collector: Owl Lady, you know where Luz is, right?
Eda: Back up, kid. I don't think I can control myself right now.
The Collector: She's really gone.
Luz: Oh. I know what I should have said... I should have thanked them.
Luz: King?
Papa Titan: No. But he does get his good looks from me.
Luz: Oh, Titan.
Papa Titan: Oh, me. Nice to meet you, Luz the Human.
Luz: You can't actually be the Titan Titan, right? You're the Boiling Isles, and that Titan is all -
Papa Titan: Dead-looking?
Luz: Does that mean I'm also—
Papa Titan: Ah, no, nope, no. Don't wanna do that. If you go under without a portal, you really will be dead-looking.
Luz: I can't believe this. You're King's dad!
Papa Titan: I think King said it best once. "I am both King and Queen, best of both things." But Dad works fine.
Luz: What is this place?
Papa Titan: This is the space in between. Well, in between a lot of places. And I've been stuck here for quite some time. But at least I can keep an eye on my child. And those who have been kind to him.
Luz: I'm not so kind. When I saw The Collector fly up to Belos, I hoped with all my heart I would see them blast him away, and— 
Papa Titan: Hey, I can relate. I was willing to do anything to keep my kid safe. But I attacked the wrong person. Dragged The Collector down here for nothing.
Luz: Does that make us as bad as Belos?
Papa Titan: What? Have you been drinking Eda's homemade Apple Blood?
Luz: Well, Belos says he's trying to save humanity. And we are saying we want to save our families. So isn't that the same thing? Don't—Don't these feelings come from the same place?
Papa Titan: You assume Belos's goal comes from a genuine place. But that man doesn't care about about anything but his need to be the hero in his own delusion. And because of that, he fears what he can't control.
Luz: And now that fear is going to win.
Papa Titan: Ah, dang.
Papa Titan: I thought I had more time left. But Belos will have full control soon. You ready to stop him?
Luz: What? What can I do?
Papa Titan: You've already helped King so much. So let me use my last bit of life to help you.
Luz: Are you sure you wanna give this power to me?
Papa Titan: Well, you're the one here, and you seem like a good witch. But I can't give you anything unless you choose to accept it. So the question is, will you choose yourself?
Papa Titan: Now, Belos will be able to control everything, so you have to defeat him fast.
Luz: But-
Papa Titan: My power won't last forever, so use your time wisely.
Luz: Oh, but what about -
Papa Titan: Eda the Owl Lady? Send her my regards, big fan.
Luz: No, King, what about King? Don't you wanna say something to him?
Luz: Oh. He'll love that. 
Papa Titan: Goodbye, Luz.
Gus: She's waking up!
Camila: Wha—what's happening? Where's Luz?
Gus: Uh—
Amity: What's wrong with my magic?
Camila: Can't you tell? You're exhausted. You all are! None of you have gotten rest in days.
Willow: But what can we do? We can't leave everyone like this.
Hunter: And what about Luz?
Camila: Luz is a Noceda. You know what that means? It means she's way too stubborn to let any of this get her down.
Camila: She'll be okay.
Camila: In the meantime, I think I know how we can help, even without your magic.
The Collector: No, please stop! Run away! Why isn't anything working?
The Collector: I don't want anyone else to go away. I don't want anyone else to go missing! I'm sorry for everything!
The Collector: What is this stuff? Wh-why won't it stop? No! No, no, no, no! Get off of her!
The Collector: Huh? It can't be—
Luz: I'm back!
Luz: I - wait - Uh. Couldn't keep me away from - Hang on. Ugh! I still can't think of anything to say!
Eda: It's Luz, all right!
Luz: Woah! Overshot it a little. Still getting used to these powers. 
Eda: Oh no, everyone's still in the Archives.
The Collector: Leave them to me. Come on, you can at least do this.
Eda: Concentrate, think of what you want and—
Luz: Yes!
King: Luz! On three! One—
Luz: Two!
King and Luz: Weh!
Luz: Eda!
Luz: Hold on.
Hunter: The Collector?
Willow: Is he—?
Gus: He's helping!
Luz: Hah! Wow.
Luz: We have to cut Belos off from The Titan's power.
Eda: What are you thinking?
Luz: Come on Eda, you know where magic comes from.
Luz, King, and Eda: From the heart!
Raine: Who's there? Stay away! 
Eda: It's okay Raine, I got ya. 
Raine: I am— still not used to this new look, but it doesn't matter. I'm just happy you're here. Luz? You look— fluffier? How long was I out for?
Luz: We don't have much time. Let's end this.
Raine: Finally.
Belos: You can't defeat me!
Luz: Do not underestimate me, Belos. For I am the Good Witch Luz, Child of the Human Realm, Student of the Demon Realm, and Warrior of Peace!
Luz: NOW EAT THIS, SUCKER!
Philip: Luz— Luz, I'm- I'm free. Thank goodness you saved me from- From that horrible curse.
Philip: Yes, I-I was cursed with a terrible, terrible sickness, by— by dark magic, just like your mentor.
Philip: It forced me to do all those horrible things, but-but now, I'm free.
Philip: AH! Qui-Quickly, now!
Philip: Don't- Don't you want- to make peace - Luz?
Philip: Don't just stand there! You'll be just as bad, just as conniving, just as evil, and just as unforgivable as those witches!
Belos: We're human. We're better than this!
Eda: Well, we ain't!
Raine: That was extremely satisfying.
King: Ew, it's on my claws!
Raine: Is that—
Eda: I think it is. Dang kid, you do have tall genes.
Luz: Oh! Your dad had a message for you. 
King: I— loaf you? I loaf you... Bread pun!
Luz: Isn't it amazing? We did it. After everything, after all that— we stuck together.
Eda: Yup, we did alright.
King: I'll say.
Luz: And that's how we saved the Boiling Isles.
Luz: Well, as much as we could.
Luz: We were so relieved to see everyone safely released from the Archives. They were spared the worst of it, at least.
Luz: Because of that, everyone got to reunite with their families and loved ones.
Amity: Dad! 
Luz: And if someone thought they had no one waiting for them, well, they were in for a nice surprise.
Luz: Still, there was a lot of work to be done—
Luz: And not everyone was keen to change things—
Luz: But we were ready to give it a shot. All of us.
Luz: As for The Collector—
Luz: —he and I made a pinky promise to keep trying our best. He said he had a lot of growing up to do, so he decided to return to the stars.
Luz: No one argued, but I think I heard King whisper, "I hope I see you again."
Luz: We got our happy ending, but I realized something in that moment.
Luz: When the Titan had finally passed on, so did the powers of the glyphs.
Luz: I had learned the Titan's language, but now I had no one to speak it to. It had helped me find my place when I had no other way. In my heart, I'll never forget it.
Luz: A whole chapter of my life was over—
Luz: —but a new one was just beginning.
Camila: ¡Ahí estás tu! ¿Puedes ayudarme a envolver a estos maduros? (There you are! Can you help me wrap these maduros?)
Luz: I'll—be right there.
Camila: I can't believe you're already leaving for college. Remind me, what major did you pick again?
Luz: C'mon mama, you know me. I picked all of 'em!
Camila: All of 'em? How is that even possible without your glyphs?
Luz: It's been tough, but me and Stringbean figured out our own way of doing things. And, it'll be nice to finally see everyone again, after all this time.
Camila: Luz— you saw them last week.
Luz: That doesn't count, I was studying for finals.
Vee: It's time. Go get the others.
The Collector: Welcome to the Boiling Isles! Watch your step.
Vee: Hurry, hurry! 
Luz: What's the rush Vee? No one's gonna be mad if we're a little late. 
Camila: Yes, but today is special.
Luz: Okay, okay.
Everyone: SURPRISE!
Luz: What is this? 
Eda: Well, since you spent your fifteenth birthday helping us rebuild the Isles—
King: —And sixteenth, and seventeenth.
Amity: We wanted to make it up to you.
Willow: Camila told us all about your quinceañeras from the Human Realm.
Gus: And they sounded a lot less haunted than our birthdays.
Lilith: Nevertheless, I made sure we followed Camila's instructions perfectly!
Camila: I- um-
Camila: Great work everyone. Muy bueno.
King: And look, look!
Eda: King's powers are getting stronger. Yeah, and it looks like they're different from his dad's. But hey, you've got a whole new glyph language to try out.
Luz: Guys—
King: We've got another surprise. The Collector was in the area and well, he wanted to do something special for the occasion. Look!
Luz: Eda, King, thank you. For everything.
Eda: Right back at ya, kiddo.
Luz: Weirdos?
Eda and King: Weirdos. 
Luz: They're nearly gone. Okay everyone, on the count of three. One, two, three!
Everyone: Bye—eee!
