Eda: Watch closely, Luz. Hexes Hold'em is the most tricky game on the Boiling Isles. Any proper witch knows how to play.
Luz: Oh boy, cards! The paper rectangles that old people think are fun!
Eda: Now when it looks like the deck is stacked against you, that's when you break out the wildcard.
Eda: Woo, I win! In your adorable owl face. Ah, I love the feeling of victory; it feels... fluffy? 
Luz: Uh, Eda? It's happening again!
Eda: What's happening again?
King: Your curse is returning!
Eda: Oh, boy.
Eda: This is terrible. I'm out of elixir.
Luz: Uh, last time this happened, you turned into this thing. 
Eda: I know I should be repulsed, but that look is fierce.
Luz: Eda!
Eda: You're right, you're right. We need to head to the market.
Luz: Market! 
King: I'm stealing everything that's not nailed down!
Eda: Before we go, would anyone like to play one more hand of Hexes Hold'em? Hey, where are my cards?
Luz: Take these and fly ahead. She'll have to follow us.
Eda: Owlbert, you sore loser, gimme back my cards!
Eda: Hey, open up, Morton!
Morton: Uh, ju—... just a minute!
Luz: Is there anything better than people watching in the Demon Realm?
Tinella Nosa: Wait, wait! Aw, dang it.
Luz: The curse of tiny legs.
King: I know the pain.
Luz: Whoa, that is one ominous parade.
Eda: That's no parade. Those are demon hunters.
Eda: Dangerous nomads who capture and sell the most powerful beasts.
Eda: ...Which I'm about to become if you don't open up, Morton! 
Morton: Sorry, Eda! I was up all night poison tasting and for some reason, I don't feel great.
Eda: I'm all outta my juice, pal.
Morton: Oh, gee. Lemme see what I can do.
Luz: Willow and Gus! Heya, friends! Wait, what's wrong? Who hurt my babies?
Willow: Them.
Willow: Amity's having a moonlight conjuring and invited everyone but me.
Gus: And she keeps posting about it on her Penstagram account.
Luz: "It's conjuring night! No dorks allowed"? What a jerk! What's a moonlight conjuring?
Willow: You spend the night at someone's house, telling stories, playing games...
Luz: Like a slumber party! We have those!
Willow: Then you bring something to life with moon magic!
Luz: Like a weird slumber party!
Willow: Gus and I have never been to one. You need at least three people and—
Luz: I'm three people—I mean, we're three people, and we're way better than them!
Boscha: Sorry you couldn't get an invite to the conjuring, Willow. Only real witches allowed.
Amity: Leave her alone. It's not her fault she was born without talent.
Luz: Whoa. Don't waste your time getting thorny over them. 'Cause we're gonna have our own moonlight conjuring.
Gus: Are you serious? This was on my bucket list. After owning a real human bucket!
Luz: That's a really weird thing to want, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'll go tell Eda.
Morton: I've got bad news and good news. Bad news is I'm all out 'till next week. Good news is feathers are a good look for you.
Eda: Morton!
Morton: Well gee, E. Why'd you wait to re-up 'till now?
Eda: I've been very busy.
King: Yeah, busy playing Hexes Hold'em. She's obsessed with it.
Eda: I am not obsessed!
King: You're playing it right now!
Eda: ...Am I winning?
Morton: You know, I wouldn't suggest this to just anybody, but if you need your elixir you could try your luck later this evening.
Eda: In the night market?
Morton: There's a guy with a stand, goes by Grimm Hammer; if anyone has what you need, it's him.
Luz: Eda, Gus and Willow and I are gonna do a moonlight conjuring and stick it to Amity. So can we—
Eda: Not tonight, I'm going out. I need you to watch the house, I have many precious objects in there.
King: Like me! Whoa!
Eda: You're coming with me. I need an extra pair of eyes looking out for pickpockets, and an extra pair of hands in case I want to pickpocket.
Eda and King: Pickpocket!
Luz: Then, maybe they can come to the house and—
Eda: No! Besides, conjurings are dumb; sitting in a circle holding hands. Pft. It's like magic for babies. 
Luz: But—
Willow: Luz! What did Eda say?
Luz: So... guys...
Gus: Oh, look! The moon is rising into place. And the celestial powers only align once a year.
Willow: Oh, I can't believe I finally have enough friends for a moonlight conjuring! Thank you, Luz! Did Eda say it was okay?
Luz: Uhm... yes. She said yes. We can do it at the Owl House. As long as we don't make a mess or touch anything and never bring up that we did it! 
Gus: Yes!
Willow: Oh, you're the best!
Willow and Gus: We're gonna do a conjuring! We're gonna do a conjuring! Conjuring! Conjuring!
Eda: Luz, you're in charge while I'm out. Make sure Hooty doesn't get into any trouble.
Hooty: Hoot hoot! I don't need a babysitter. I'm a big boy house!
Luz: You can count on me; I'd never betray your hard-earned trust. 
Eda: You're acting suspicious. You're doing that thing where you hide in your hoodie.
Luz: Meow I'm not. Uh... Oh, where's King?
Eda: He's right here.
Eda: His little body just conks out when he's weightless. Look at this.
Luz: Aww, he's so dangly. 
Eda: Anyway, really going now. And Luz...
Eda: ...if you mess up the house, I will never trust you again. No pressure! Byeeeeee!
Luz: Ay. Should I really be doing this? No, no, Willow is counting on you. Okay, she's gone.
Willow: Release!
Willow: I'm a sneaky sneakster!
Gus: I've got leaves in my pants...and I like it.
Hooty: Company! Hooray! Finally someone to listen to my stories! Okay, one time, a sparrow flew into my mouth, and then I—
Hooty: Hey...
Luz: Welcome to, the living room. We call it that because it's technically living! The walls are breathing, look.
Willow: Enchanting.
Gus: And look at all these human treasures. And actual humans!
Luz: We've got snacks, we've got weird music!
Gus: We've got a bucket!
Luz: Gus, my man.
Willow: And best of all we have actual friends to do the conjuring with! This is so exciting!
Luz: So how does this conjuring stuff work?
Willow: Well first, we find an object to animate. Since it's our first time we should pick something meaningful. Something beautiful.
Gus: Like this strangely buff little man? 
Beefy Bob: I'm half beef, half Bob!
Luz: Yes! He's perfect!
Willow: That's not exactly what I meant by "beautiful".
Willow: Okay, buff boy it is.
Luz: Yes! 
Gus: Tonight he shall be risen!
Willow: According to the conjuring books I've read, we say the incantation and make a connection with the doll.
Gus: Figurine.
Willow and Gus: Moonlight, we call, we sing. Moonlight take this chance. Moonlight come tie the string. Moonlight start the dance!
Luz: Moonlight tie... string... and I don't know the words!
Gus: That's your cue, little man.
Luz: Guys? Did the entire house just hiccup?
Gus: Little buff guy, what did you do?
Beefy Bob: A real man never takes accountability!
Willow: No, I think—I think we might've animated the house by accident!
Luz: The house?
Luz: Hooty? Hooty! Hooty, you have to stop!
Hooty: By the power of moonlight, I have risen. Hoot hoot.
Gus: He's in some kind of trance!
Willow and Luz: Gus!
Willow: Our magic must've spread through the house instead of the doll!
Gus: Figurine!
Luz: Hooty, stop!
Gus: How'd we do that?
Luz: Willow, Gus, hold hands again.
Willow: We're controlling it with the power of friendship. Uh, and the moon. Probably the moon.
Gus: This is amazing! What do we do now?
Luz: On the one hand, we should probably stay put.
Gus: On the other hand, we've got a giant walking house and should totally take it on a joyride!
Luz: Okay, okay, but we gotta be back before the moon sets or Eda will kill me.
Gus and Luz: Yeah! Joyride!
Eda: The curse. I need that elixir. Quick. Hey, you. You know where I can find a Grimm Hammer?
Willow: Hey, is that...
Gus: It's Boscha. That girl who made fun of us.
Boscha: Ugh! Yes, Mom. I'm going to a moonlight conjuring. No, Mom. You can't come. And yes, Mom, it's sad that you're asking.
Willow: She noticed us. What do we do?
Luz: Hmm. Hey. H-Hey you. You should, uh, stop being so mean to people. You're kind of a jerk.
Boscha: Ew. A talking house is giving me a lecture? Whatever. I'll just TP you like I did with the rest of the neighborhood.
Luz: But don't you see? I am no mere house.
Gus: I've never pranked anyone before. And now I have a taste for it.
Willow: We should follow her to Amity's house to show off our conjuring. That will show her who's got no talent.
Luz: Actually, I'm starting to think we should head back.
Gus: Amity's updating her Penstagram.
Luz: "Shout out to my fellow witches. #Humans can bite it." Let's do it.
Eda: Hello? Uh, I seek the one they call Grimm Hammer.
Tibbles: I'm the one they call Grimm Hammer.
Tibbles: Welcome, welcome, welcome. I've got weaponry from the Hinterlands, curses from the Winterlands, and jelly beans.
King: Jellybeans!
Tibbles: They're lethally delicious.
Eda: You are Grimm Hammer?
Tibbles: Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the Third. Please, call me Tibbles.
King: He wants to be called that.
Eda: Okay, Tibbles. I need some of this elixir. 
Tibbles: Oh. This is one wicked brew. Lucky for you, I just stocked up.
Eda: Huzzam! I'll give you ten snails.
Tibbles: Add two more zeros and it's a deal.
Eda: A thousand snails? What kind of game are you playing?
Tibbles: Capitalism. Where everyone wins, except you.
Eda: Hey! Say, you play Hexes Hold'em?
King: Really? Now?
Tibbles: Oh! Is that what that game is called? I was just using these as coasters.
Eda: How about we make it interesting? I win, you give me the elixir. You win, you can take something of mine.
Tibbles: Oh, what fun. You're on.
Willow: Look, Amity's house. Time to show Amity what a real conjuring looks like.
All: Wha—
Willow: What happened?
Luz: Is that a... giant crossbow?
Demon Hunter #1: Knock, knock.
Luz: Hooty! Hooty! You have to wake up!
Hooty: If you want this to end as you say, three must hold hands. It's the only way.
Luz: ¡Oye, no me hable así! Willow, will you help me out with Hooty?
Willow: I'm sorry, Luz. You shouldn't ask me to help with anything.
Luz: Willow.
Luz: Did the house stop moving?
Gus: Uh, my insides didn't.
All: Ow! Ow! Ow! 
Demon Hunter #1: Take the house and rip out the house demon. We can sell it to restaurants as exotic meat.
Luz: No! Hooty would taste terrible.
Hooty: Hey, I'm a refined taste. Hoot! Hoot!
Demon Hunter #3: What do we do with the worms?
Demon Hunter #1: Throw them over the cliff.
Demon Hunter #3: All righty, kids. Here's the end of your short little lives.
Gus: Wait! Wait! Wait! Is this really what you wanna be doing with your life? Tossing kids from cliffs?
Demon Hunter #3: Actually, yes. It's been my dream since I was a boy.
Demon Hunter #3: I was a strange child. Whee! 
Luz: If we're not killed now, we will be when Eda finds out about the house.
Willow: Luz, I'm so sorry. You wanted to turn back but I just had to show off to Amity. The truth is she and I used to be friends.
Luz: Whaaat?
Willow: We played together as kids, but when she got her magical powers and I didn't, she stopped hanging out with me.
Gus: Guys, is now the best time?
Willow: I just wanted to prove to her that I was a powerful witch, too.
Luz: That's ridiculous. You helped bring a house to life. Amity doesn't know what she's talking about.
Luz: Next to Eda, you're the most powerful witch I know. No offense, Gus.
Gus: No, not at all. I know what I'm about.
Gus: This tree can't hold us much longer.
Willow: There. Now, if I could just reach that root. Gotcha!
King: Oof. That was painful to watch.
Eda: You card shark. You hustled me.
Tibbles: Looks like you forgot about my wild card.
Card: Yeah!
Tibbles: In any case, I'd like my prize now. And I choose... the little bone boy. I've always wanted a tiny servant to model my line of baby clothes.
King: No! I don't look good in clothes. I'm all-natural. Eda, do something!
Eda: I can't perform magic.
Eda: You think this can stop me? I can still bite your ankles.
Tibbles: You don't think I know who you are? Eda, the Owl Lady.
Tibbles: That's right. I've seen your wanted posters around here. I wonder how much the Emperor's Coven would pay me to hand you over?
Demon Hunter #3: Yeah, they tried to fight back and they nearly got me. But you know, I handled it.
Demon Hunter #1: They were children, Tom.
Willow: We may be children, but we're also witches. Powerful ones.
Luz: Everyone, quick!
Demon Hunter #1: Uh...
Luz: Oh, no. I don't mean to step on this victory but we gotta get home before Eda does.
Demon Hunter #3: "They're just children, Tom."
Eda: King, I'm sorry.
King: King? Who's King? I go by Little Bone Boy now.
Eda: I know I have a problem. I get obsessed with Hexes Hold'em. But I'm done with that stupid game. Look. 
King: You promise?
Eda: I promise.
King: Okay, okay. I'll grab you the elixir and then we can bust out of here.
Tibbles: Bone boy!
King: Heh?
Tibbles: You will do no such thing. The Emperor's Coven is already on its way to send this witch here to the Conformatorium. And I just rustled up some more clothes for you to try on. 
King: Just because I have a model's body doesn't mean you can use me like this.
Tibbles: I can and I am, bone boy. I've got the cards stacked against you.
Tibbles: And nothing can stop me. Nothing!
Luz: Sorry, mister.
Eda: Wait, what—Was that my house?
King: Eda, quick!
Tibbles: No, no, no! My scam stand.
Eda: Sorry, Tibbles, old boy. It looks like you forgot about the wild card.
Tibbles: Curse you, witch. Curse you, bone boy. I'll have my revenge. Tibblet-Tibblie Grimm Hammer the Third will have his revenge.
Luz: Did we do it?
Hooty: Is the room spinning or is it just me? Ah. Just a little house humor. Ooh.
Luz: Sorry about all that, Hooty.
Hooty: It's okay. I'm just glad I was included.
Luz: Oh, boy.
Eda: You are so busted.
Luz: Oh, man.
Eda: You held a moonlight conjuring.
Luz: I did.
Eda: And you animated my house. My house!
Luz: Yes.
Willow: No. Don't punish Luz. We're the ones who pushed her to do the conjuring.
Gus: If you're gonna eat me, just do it now. Do it now!
Luz: Hey, you didn't have to do that.
Willow: Yes, Luz. I did.
Eda: Well, you're all guilty, so you'll all be punished by cleaning my house top to bottom.
Eda: And another thing...
Eda: That was totally amazing. And I'm so joining you for next year's conjuring. Now get to work.
King: I can't believe they animated a whole house.
Eda: Yeah. You're right. That takes some powerful magic.
Luz: You know, I still kinda wish we got to show up Amity.
Willow: Yeah. Too bad no one will know of our daring adventures.
Boscha: Ugh. So what if we couldn't move a doll. Now we have time for what really matters. Penstagram.
Amity and Boscha: What?!
