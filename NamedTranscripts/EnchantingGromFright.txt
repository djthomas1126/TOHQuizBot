Luz: Come on! Work this time. Yes! Check it out, King: my glyph skills are blossoming!
King: You think that's impressive? Check this out! Two warriors battling to the death!
Luz: Ah. I see we're getting enough Wi-Fi through the portal for cat videos.
King: Senseless violence. Yes, attack! Death is your god!
Luz: I regret teaching you about the Internet.
King: Hah! What possible regrets could come from the Internet? Oh! Did you know that the Earth is actually flat?
Luz: Yep, that's not right.
Luz: Good enough.
King: Ah, a severed hand! Perfect response.
Luz: Ugh! What am I supposed to say? "Hey, Mom, not at camp actually! I'm in the demon realm learning to be a witch! Also, did you know demons and magic are real?" She. Will. End me.
King: Nah, she'd be freaked out by our world anyway. So actually, by keeping the truth from her, you're doing her a favor!
Luz: Hm. The demon on my shoulder makes a good point.
King: Always trust a shoulder demon!
Hooty: Hoot hoot, Luz! Time to fill up that darling little head of yours with... Mm-hmm. Delicious knowledge!
Gus: Please hurry!
Willow: The more I look at him, the more uncomfortable I get.
Hooty: Hoot hoot!
Luz: Hehe. Don't spend all day watching MewTube, 'kay?
King: I forge my own path!
King: What a dum-dum.
King: Ugh. Who has the energy?
Spider Teacher: Coming through! Watch your heads!
Luz: Something's different today. Did everyone get a haircut?
Willow: Oh yeah! I forgot you've never been here for the social event of the season.
Gus: Welcome to your first—
Worker: Outta the way!
Worker: Come with us immediately! Your disease—it's advancing!
Bat Boy: Is there a cure, doc?
Worker: Only one... finding the perfect date to Grom!
Bat Boy: If that's the cure... then, Skara, will you go to Grom with me?
Skara: Ahhhhh! Of course I will, or whatever!
Luz: You guys have a weird version of prom on the Boiling Isles? I was kicked out of my last school dance for dressing like an otter, but maybe here, I could be your Grom Queen!
Willow: That's, uh, not something people usually sign up for.
Amity: Watch it, nitwit! Oh. Hi, Luz... and co. Sorry about that.
Luz: No problem, let me help you!
Luz: Here, your note.
Luz: Man, you got some quick grabbers.
Amity: It's just, it's... private.
Student #2: I'm so nervous.
Student #3: Shh! This is it!
Principal Bump: Attention Hexside students. This is your principal speaking.
Gus: Oh, man, this is it!
Willow: He's announcing who'll be this year's Grom royalty.
Principal Bump: This year, I have the privilege to bestow our highest Grom honor to... Amity Blight!
Principal Bump: Our Grom Queen!
Student #4: It's Amity!
Student #5: Amity.
Luz: Whoo! Amity, get it, queen!
Luz: Don't leave me hangin'!
Willow: You might want to give her some space. Being Grom Queen is a tough job. Even for Amity.
Principal Bump: Very good. Lower the streamers, fill the punch bowl, and—how's my disco ball?
Snaggleback: Nauseous.
Principal Bump: Great. Just keep it up for 36 more hours.
Luz: Ah. My first school dance experience on the Boiling Isles. I can't wait to get overdressed, take awkward photos, push all the buttons—wait, what?
Luz: Well, hello. Don't mind if I do.
Luz: Woah!
Luz: Medieval torture seems like a strange theme for Grom, but hey—
Amity: They're not for decoration.
Amity: This arena's where I'll make my debut as Grom Queen.
Luz: Right. Why don't you seem excited?
Amity: Because this isn't just some dance party.
Amity: That's Grom. Short for Grometheus, the Fear-Bringer. It's a monster that lives under the school.
Amity: Every year it tries to break out, and a student had to defeat it before it invades the town. Ever the optimist, Bump holds a party and calls it tradition.
Amity: The worst thing is that Grom can read minds and shape-shift into your worst fear. And mine... is very embarrassing. 
Luz: If it worries you so much, then why don't you tell Principal Bump you want out of this death match biz? Unless talking to Bump is your greatest fear.
Amity: No, but that's a good idea. Thanks, Luz.
Luz: Hm.
Snaggleback: Put down a tarp, I'm gonna puke!
Luz: I'm home!
Eda: Ow!
Luz: Guys?
Eda: Careful with those pins.
King: Why am I doing this? I don't even wear clothes!
Luz: Hey, sweet duds, Owl Lady! What's the haps? 
Eda: I'm chaperoning Grom tonight. So I have to look sharp.
King: And Gus asked me to co-emcee the fight!
King: We're going to turn this blood-bath into a fun-bath!
Eda: Ooh! Have they announced the victim yet?
Luz: Yeah. It's Amity. She's kinda freaking out though. I wish I could, like, take her place or something.
King: A great joke, Luz!
Eda: Ah, listen, kid. That's a noble sentiment, but Grom is a little above your pay-grade. You're a human. You're... fragile.
Luz: Hey! I've been learning lots of new spells! I could totally handle it.
Eda: There's a horrifying spider in your hair.
Luz: Nope. I'm not as fragile as you think, Eda. And I can't be so easily fooled, either.
King: Uh, maybe you were too hard on her. She's saved you from multiple monsters, remember?
Eda: Facing Grom means facing your worst fear, King. And I don't think Luz knows what that means yet.
Eda: Do you think I could pull off red eyeshadow?
King: Girl, you can pull off anything! Up top! We're style geniuses!
Luz: "Fragile". Eda doesn't know me! I-I'm brave! I'm a bad boy!
Luz: Ominous footsteps, creepy woods. This is no problem.
Luz: Luz chop! Aaaaaahhhhhh!
Amity: Ow!
Luz: Oh my gosh, Amity! I'm so sorry!
Amity: And here I thought this day... Oop!
Amity: ...couldn't get any worse.
Luz: Did you talk to Bump? Was it as terrifying as you imagined?
Amity: He said no. I'm Grom Queen, unless I can find a replacement. And who'd want to switch with me?
Luz: I would.
Amity: What?
Luz: Amity Blight, I'll do it. I'll take your place and face Grom in the arena. I'll be your fearless champion!
Luz: Fearless... champion..
Luz: Hmmm...
Luz: Hmm!
Hooty: Oh, Luz! You have a guest!
Luz: Hooty! No touching!
Luz: Amity!
Amity: If that bird-tube ever talks to me again, I'm going to destroy it. You ready to train?
Luz: Which should I wear to Grom? This one says, "witch with a dark side." But this one says, "I'm an otter... with a dark side."
Amity: Luz, you need to take this seriously. If you can't defeat Grom, everyone on the island will have to live out their worst nightmare.
Hooty: You wanna hear my worst nightmare?
Hooty: Hooty-hoot! Hoot, hoot!
Luz: Stop, stop! Amity, Amity, wai—Amity, stop!
Amity: Grom will transform into your darkest fears. What are you afraid of, Luz?
Edric: Wanna say our greatest fears? On three. One, two... being alone forever!
Emira: Being stuck with you forever.
Luz: In preparation, I've made a list!
Luz: Jerks online who wanna debate!
Luz: AH!
Cat: Luz, help me! Help!
Luz: Human souls trapped in cat bodies!
Cat: I don't want to be this.
Luz: No! I'm lactose intolerant!
Amity: Not enough. The reason I can't face Grom—it goes deeper than things that just gross me out. What's your real fear, Luz?
Luz: My real fear... is that Eda thinks I'm too fragile to do this! And if she's right, I'll never be a real witch!
Eda Illusion: You're inadequate.
Eda: Me-ow. Still got it.
Luz: No!
Eda: I get it. Ditch the yellow. Is that supposed to be me?
Eda: Dang, I look great. Wait a sec. You're training to be Grom Queen!
Luz: So what if I am? 
Eda: You think training will help against Grom? Luz, you always go overboard and I end up bailing you out. Now, what's the fun in watching a kid get eaten by a monster if it's my kid?
Luz: Well, maybe you'll have fun watching me defeat Grom!
Amity: Luz, I don't think you're ready, but we're literally out of time.
Luz: I'll take it!
Snaggleback: Arms so tired.
King: Why so twitchy, witchy? Trying to remember if I've ever seen you this worried before.
Eda: Well, of course I'm worried! I'm going to have to save Luz from a nightmare monster! Ugh, so much for Mama's fun night out.
Gus: Ladies, gentlemen, and assorted demons!
Gus: It's almost time for our main Grom event. Please, please, take a seat, and be aware that the first three rows are designated splash zones.
King: Wow, Gus is really good at this. They're hanging on his every word!
Gus: I see we've got Principal Bump in the house! Now, sir, I hope you won't throw us in detention because, uh, we're going to raise the roof.
King: Whoo, I, uh, hope my material's up to snuff. Whoah!
King: What do you think will go better with the youths, close-up magic or impressions?
Eda: Oh, King. Teenagers are brutal. They'll boo anyone, and that kind of public humiliation can stick with you for life.
King: Aaahh!
Luz: I'm not sure if it's nerves or if I accidentally drank some milk, but something's making my stomach squirm.
Amity: Uh, you look nice. Strange, but... nice. And, thank you, Luz. Honestly, I'm kind of amazed with how fearless you are. You've done things I could never do.
Luz: Hah! Yeah right! You goin' soft on me, Blight?
Amity: In your dreams.
Gus: Now, introducing our Grom Queen. You know her, you love her... you've at least heard of her. Luz, the Human!
Luz: Wish me luck!
Amity: Luck.
Date: Grom!
Skara: Yes, Grom!
Luz: There you are, Gromarama. Not too scary.
Cats: Luz, help me. I'm a man. Make me human again.
Luz: Ugh, so weird.
Gus: And there she goes, folks! Using that characteristic human magic to keep Grom at bay! And now, to hand things over to my co-emcee: King!
King: Hel-LO, Hexside! So...
King: Oh, oh gosh. Um... whoo. Wow, these lights are warm. Observe! Luz, is um... she's down there, all right. And, uh, yes she is! There she goes! Folks, she's battling the thing, and uh...
Guest: Bring back the funny kid!
King: You will clap for me! Please?
Gus: King! 
Luz: You're not coming from a place of intellectual honesty, so debating you would be pointless!
Principal Bump: Luz has lasted surprisingly long. But what form will Grom take next?
Luz: Let's finish this! Human-style!
Luz: Huh?
Grom-Camila: Mija?
Luz: Mom! What are you doing here?
Grom-Camila: Luz, what is this terrible place? Espérate un momento, this isn't camp. Have you been here, all these weeks? And is that a weapon?
Luz: Ah! I can explain!
Grom-Camila: Mija, have you been lying to me?! 
Gus: What's going on, little dude?
King: Nothing! Leave me be! 
Gus: The thing is, you're sitting in my personal chit-chat zone, which means you gotta talk.
King: Well if that's the rule... Oh, how can this be? I get stage fright! Me! The King of Demons!
Gus: Well, sometimes, you just have to—
King: I know, I know. Imagine everyone in their underwear.
Gus: Gross! Why would you do that?
King: I dunno. I always do that. I am a little weirdo.
Gus: No, King. Sometimes you just have to face your fear, like Luz is doing right now.
Luz: I can't do it! I can't face my fear!
Grom-Camila: Why are you running, Luz?
Principal Bump: Grom has escaped.
Students: He escaped! Oh no! Grom escaped. What are we gonna do?
Gus: King, now's your chance.
King: Gimme! King of Demons, you got this. Well, folks, looks like our show literally just took off!
King: Weh?
Gus: You gotta pander.
King: Uh, took off just like your local sports team would take off when they're about to make a goal?
Students: Yeah, sports team! Sports team! Oh, yeah! I love our team!
King: Yeah, that's right, so let's follow them and see what happens next.
Luz: I don't wanna be Grom Queen anymore! I give up the throne!
Grom-Camila: Why can't you face me, Luz? Why can't you face your own mother?
Luz: You're not really my mom! 
Grom-Camila: How could you say that, cariño?! You're breaking my heart!
Eda: Spicy toss! Hands off my human, you misshapen excuse for a monster!
Luz: Eda! You're right! I'm not ready!
Eda: That's okay, I got this one. 
Eda: Huh?
Amity: Stay away from her!
Amity: I'm sorry, Luz. I should have fought my own battle.
Amity: I— 
Luz: Amity! No, your fear!
Luz: Who is that?
Luz: You were afraid of getting rejected. Amity, it's okay. What if I went to Grom with you instead?
Amity: Really?
Luz: That's what friends do.
Amity: Well, then, if that's settled, may I have this dance?
Luz: So... who did you wanna ask out?
Amity: Oh, it's... it's not important.
King: And there you have it, folks. A happy ending for this year's Grom. Let's give a big hand to our Grom Queens, Luz and Amity!
Gus: You did it, buddy!
King: Of course I did it! I'm the King of Demons and I've never had stage fright in my life!
King: They love me!
Eda: Whoo! Watch out for this, human! Oh, you did good, kid.
Luz: Thanks, but... I'm gonna go to bed.
King: Now I am king and queen! Best of both things!
Luz: In the end, I couldn't face my mom. Maybe I am fragile.
Luz: Hmm.
Luz: I won't lie. Today was kinda hard.
Luz: And I don't always feel like I'm supposed to be here.
Luz: But when things get tough, my friends help me out.
Luz: I think you'd like them.
Luz: Te extraño también, Mami. One day, I'll tell you all about this.
Luz: Aw. That's a cute way of saying "text".
Snaggleback: Wow. What a night. Now, can someone let me down?
Snaggleback: Anyone...?
