What is this place?
You know exactly where we are, human.
You got us trapped in the Emperor's mind!
Huh?!
We're in the Emperor's mind? That's bananas!
I don't know what those are, and I don't care too. Remember what happened at the Night Market?
Teeth! Get your teeth! We got all varieties and qualities!
I even do trades.
Oh, I... mean, why would I trade teeth? That's illegal and unsanitary. But, I mean, if you're interested...
I heard whispers of an attempt to invade the Emperor's mind with wild magic. I decided to take the villains out myself.
But just as I was about to stop them...
Halt! For crimes against the Emperor, you are under arrest!
Oh, wait! I remember now!
Hey!
Eda took me and King to the Night Market to repair my witch's wool cape. But, we ran into some trouble.
Hello? Prim? Did you get into the Night Juice again? Hello?
Is this thing on? Demon King to Luzura, you copy?
Sure do!
Use the walkie!
Oh, uh, right. 10-4, Demon King. Luzura here with Echo, Delta, Alfa. What's your 20? Over.
Uh, oh. Uh... Hable más lento, por favor. 
Aw, you remembered your lesson. But that wasn't Spanish, buddy. I read you loud and clear! Over.
Hey, Prim!
Ah, there you are. I need more witch's wool. I got a kid with cold shoulders and a knack for gettin' into trouble.
The shop is closed, Eda. I've... finally decided to join a coven.
Emperor Belos says wild witches celebrate destruction and... pain.
I mean, I know I can be... abrasive, but-
He also says that the Titan punishes those who aid wild witches. I can't have you here.
Well, what does he know?! Belos is a liar. He just wants power! And I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that he can't speak to the Titan!
Do you think she's right?
Don't let the Titan hear you say that. Belos says he can read minds.
What even is a doughnut?
Hey, I'll be fine. You're the one who needs to be careful.
But people should know who Belos really is!
And who is he, really?
Listen, Belos has been Emperor for 50 years. Everyone is used to this. No one's gonna risk change unless you have proof that he's up to something.
Ah, come on. We'll figure something out. But first, let's see if there are any respectable criminals left in this city.
I hate seeing people look at Eda that way. But how can I prove he's actually evil? It feels so obvious, but no one believes me! No one answers my letters! I don't know what to do!
No one wants to think they've wasted their life following the wrong person. You just gotta find something big to change their minds.
King's right. How can I find that something?
Perfect timing.
Halt!
For crimes against the Emperor, you are all under arrest!
Hunter!
Hey! Can I bug you with a few questions?
Human?!
No, no, no! Stop! I forbid you to flee!
Human! Do you know what you've just done?!
Uh... what's that?
You wanna prove that my uncle is evil? And you thought I would help? 
Well, now that I'm in his mind, I can learn the truth for myself. Weird though. I've been in Willow's mind once, and it had more, uh, trees.
Eh, makes sense. Mindscapes reflect the individual. I've read a lot about this subject.
Whoa, look at this memory!
You know, unfettered wild magic wiped out our family. Everyone knew too much and got themselves hurt. That's why Belos took in the survivors, and dedicated his life to making the Coven System! It's why he's so well-liked!
Our sigils protect us from ourselves, and make the Titan happy.
Oh! This is when I inherited my staff! You know, I'm the youngest scout to become Golden Guard. I, uh, never found out what happened to the previous one.
Huh, why does Darius look so sad here?
Belos?
Belos?
Huh?
Emperor, you're here! We beg for your assistance to return to the physical world, so that I may capture your enemies! And so she can ruin someone else's day.
Hunter! Watch out!
Where are we now?
We must be in the Emperor's real mind.
What do you mean the Emperor's real mind? That gallery-
Was made of all the lies he tells. He's not who you think he is.
We're probably being punished because you provoked his inner self.
Well, his inner self had a thousand glowing eyeballs!
Oh, no! Eyeballs! You're so easy to scare.
Boo!
Ah!
Luz, where are you? Oh, wait. Hey, blondie, your friend wants to talk to you.
Uh...
Flapjack! Are you okay? Have they hurt you?
Give me that! So, Eda. We may kinda sorta be trapped in, uh... the Emperor's mind.
How in the world did you- No, we don't have time for that. Has the Inner Belos spotted you yet?
Yes, but we were able to get away... with help. Can there be two inner selves?
No. But I have heard of strong emotions materializing. Just stay safe. If you're devoured in his mindscape-
We'll be trapped! Dragged down into his subconscious forever. I... told you I read about this stuff.
Well, we're gonna get you out! We'll make a return spell as fast as we can!
Just don't lose the walkie-talkie. It's our only connection to you.
You got it, Owl Lady. Over and out.
Wait!
I'll be home soon, Flapjack. Stay safe.
I love you. Over and out.
Aww!
Huh?
It's you! Kid Belos!
What?
Thank you for helping us before. You don't seem as scary as your inner self.
If strong emotions can take form, maybe he's the Emperor's... I don't know, sense of guilt?
What? Belos has never done anything worthy of feeling guilt. It's obviously his... uh, sense of innocence. His pure intentions!
Well, whichever it is, I think he can help us stay safe. And maybe you can show us who Belos really is.
What was that?
No time! Let's go, go, go!
Wait! You're just gonna invade his memories? That's sacrilege!
It's a way to survive!
Hooty, I need you to lock down the house. Windows shut, curtains drawn, absolutely zero distractions.
King, go grab all the textbooks you can find.
This is gonna be tough without magic. Hooty! Chop-chop!
Ma'am!
Oh, hey, your buddy's trapped too, right? The angry blond kid?
Eda's smart but... without magic, I'm afraid she can't do much.
He says he can talk to the Titan.
The Titan's dead, how is that possible?
Fellow citizens, we are born into chaos. Our lives anger the Titan. My own family has been hurt by the darkness of wild magic.
I've been shown the healing light, it shines in nine hues!
See? He's always been helping people.
The wild witches! They have found me, run!
You incompetent fool! You nearly took my head off with that blast.
I'm sorry, Lord Belos!
I'm off to the next town.
Uh, what about... the rest of these?
Put on a bigger show.
Belos was lying! Wild witches weren't attacking him. How could you help someone like that? 
That was... probably a... special technique to get people to listen to his message. It's... It's for the greater good.
Ah! He found us!
What's the kid doing?
Shh!
Look at what wild magic has done to your city. Now imagine what it's doing to you. A city can rise from the ashes, but a soul...
What does that mean?
Wait, what?
I can make your magic pure again, as the Titan intended!
Welcome, to your new covens!
They're... still alive.
Then we still have some work to do. Gather the Palismen.
You can't deny it now. Belos is trying to hurt people!
He was just... perfecting sigil magic! Besides, maybe, he's remembering things wrong. Who knows how mindscapes work?
I thought you did!
Well, maybe I'm an idiot! You! Get back here!
Huh?
Hunter!
He's got the portal?! Did you know about this?
Of course. I helped rebuild it.
I can hear you.
You caught me!
To you, who stray so far from home. To me, who's trapped beneath these bones. We'll play forever, me and you, when you paint the land in nine bright hues!
What can I do for you, Collector?
I'm bored! Is the Draining Spell ready yet? I wanna play and see everything go all...
You'll have your fun on the Day of Unity.
Betrayed, beguiled, alone, deceived! We'll have our revenge on... Ugh, "unity" is so hard to rhyme.
I- I know you didn't want me going to Eclipse Lake. But if I hadn't, I wouldn't have found this!
Some... of the Titan blood did spill, but- but if you let me explain then-
Leave. Now.
Ooh, you were maaaaad. I thought you were gonna go all... ...on that kid.
Not as long as he stays in the right path. I say, "The Titan has big plans for you," and he does what he's told. Unlike the previous attempts.
I'm starting to think you make those things just to destroy them. You have fun with it. Admit it! 
Of course I don't, Collector. It hurts every time he chooses to betray me.
Sounds like he wants to wipe out all life in the Demon Realm. And the sigils help him do that.
Hunter, um, listen. You don't need to return to the castle. You can stay at the Owl House if you want. I'm sure Eda would be cool with it once we... tell her what we... heard. 
Hey! Stop that!
Why would he do that?
Get away from him! Danger! Danger! Run!
Are those... Palismen...?!
We weren't running from the Inner Belos. He was with us, the whole time. 
Hello, Hunter. Hello, Luz.
Ah. I was finally able to catch it. This thing's been a thorn in my side for years. All these weepy Palismen souls...
Their voices constantly nagging me. Vile. But without them, I wouldn't be able to do this.
Ah... I'm feeling better already. Thank you for distracting it.
What did you do to the other guards...? To our family?! It wasn't wild magic, was it?
What a shame.
Out of all the grimwalkers, you looked the most like him.
What...?
Hunter!
No, no, no!
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Just... hang on! Just...
I was really expecting him to last longer than the others.
I'm gonna tell everyone about the Day of Unity, that you've been lying about the Titan for years!
Yes, this has gone on longer than I'd have liked. But... no one ever said being a witch hunter was easy.
Witch... hunter? So all this time, people have been mindlessly helping a witch hunter?! How could they be tricked so easily?!
I wouldn't be so judgmental, if I were you.
His pretty little words should make pretty good kindling.
That doesn't belong to you.
No. No, no, no.
Astounding!
It's okay, we can help!
I know you want to get home, but nothing is worth hurting people!
I just need to live long enough to see this through.
No, no, no! You're Belos! You're just Belos!
Please, do me a kindness, and call me by my real name.
I... can't.
You're Philip Wittebane, aren't you?
I can't believe I taught Philip something new!
I'll go talk to Philip.
Philip, why did you bring us here?
Bones, dirt, and muck! I don't have time to fail!
Inopportune interruption, eh? I'll handle this.
Eda? Tell me it's... gonna be okay.
Eda!
Special delivery from a secret admirer!
Hooty, that thing could be booby-trapped. Get it outta here.
It's the teleportation potion into the mindscape! But who would...
Figure it out later. Now we can save Luz.
Hold up. It says it still needs a power source. And a big one.
Use this!
But... that's the last of Luz's Titan Blood. She needs it to get back home!
She'll never get home if she doesn't get back here!
Kid, you there? We're getting you two out.
It does feel good to hear another human say that name. I had to change it when Philip was run out of too many towns.
I told you once before, Luzura.
Perhaps... 
...we were destined to meet. 
And what about Hunter? What's a grimwalker?
He's... a better version of an old friend. But, thanks to you, I'll have to make another one.
She's not answering! Luz? Luz!
But... why? Why go through all this?
I'll do anything to save humanity from evil.
No.
Luz, we're gonna start the countdown. Are you ready?
You're evil.
Can't reason with crazy.
Luz!
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One!
Eda, now, please, now!
Don't crowd them. Are you two okay?
He knows. He... he knows we were in there. I can't... I can't go back!
Kid, breathe.
Hunter!
What the heck happened in there?
Luz, what did you see?
