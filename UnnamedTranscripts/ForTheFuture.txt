We gotta stick together!
I'm sorry. Not this time.
No...!
Luz, I'm so happy I had you as a big sister.
King!!!
Goodbye.
I'M FREE!!! I'm free! Oh this is the goodest I've felt in forever and ever, it's like the whole world is singing!
Yeah, I wouldn't call that singing…
So, tell me about your game "The Owl House". You promised you'll teach me if I stopped the Draining Spell!
Well, it's uh... like playing pretend. We get roles and go on adventures. But this is too crazy! We can't play if you are freaking everyone out!
King!
What are you doing up there?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
I don't know what you are, but STAY AWAY FROM MY NEPHEW!
That's my best friend you're talking to. Hands OFF!
LULU!!!
Hootsifer!
You can't hurt people either!
But they're not hurt! They are safe and sound in our new house.
Now, what part do I get to play?
You look fun! Wanna play?
Huh?
Luz!
You were in there for so long, we- we thought you got stuck behind! Are you... hurt anywhere?
I'm... I- I'm fine.
I... saw something or... someone. But it was probably just in my head. Any sign of... him?
Oh come on! It's not like a swarm of ghosts will inexplicably appear if you say his name! ...I think. Anyway, if Belos WAS here, he's long gone now.
Well, he better stay out of our way. This mama's HUNGRY FOR VENGANCE! 
Now THAT is a fight I'd watch!
Okay, everyone. Coast is clear. Hmm?
Oh, hello, red grass! I've missed you! I can't talk for long, we're on a mission to save the Boiling Isles.
Willow's back, hooray!
Well we don't have time for "red grass" or... i- illusions! Belos had a head start, so we should keep moving until we find him!
Don't worry! I bet we'll all feel better when we punch Belos RIGHT through the face. And yes, I mean THROUGH the face.
Thanks, Willow. You're always looking out for us, aren't ya?
Well someone has to! And it looks like my job here is done.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, wow! You kids were really holding back in the Human Realm, huh?
Maybe a little.
Ah! Hello, you gorgeous slime!
Mija, you never told me how pretty this place was! The trees, the sky, qué belleza...AHHHHH!!!
Kids, stand back! Who knows if that monster is alive or not?
Actually, the... Titan skull is normal. Everything else is... wrong.
Guys? What's on top of the skull?
I don't know, but... maybe we can get some answers in Bonesborough.
Wow! Skulls, bones... I can really see this place helping you with your taxidermy hobby.
Mama, you're pretending to like this place, aren't you? 
Nooooo! I love the fact that you've been living on a giant... carcass. 
It's sweet of you, really. But I haven't changed my mind.
After we rescue Eda and King, I'm staying in the Human Realm. Permanently. It's for the best.
Wait, let's talk first!
Don't... mock me! I tried to save your soul. It's your fault this all happened!
I need... a new body.
What is this place?
Welcome...
... to the Owl House.
So... this is the... Owl House I heard so much about?
Yeah... but don't worry, the food's usually not THAT spoiled. 
Food?? I need some advice.
Well first you have to pluck out all the dire rat's extra heads. The tiny ones that line the digestive tract might still be bitey, so-
I- No, I need advice about Luz.
See, she's planning to... make a very bad decision for herself. She's so determined to make herself sad, and... I don't know what to do.
That... reminds me of when I failed my first school project. I thought I deserved to be grounded so... I ran off to live in a cave in the most DRAMATIC way possible! Of course, reliable ol' Willow finds me and says...
"Augustus, it's okay to fail. Look at me! I fail all the time!"
"Oh yeah?" I said, "Like when?" Suddenly, there's this BIG slimy explosion in the distance!
"Like tonight! I forgot to chain up my Abomination homework."
They have to chain up their homework...?
Maybe Luz is going through something like that. My dad didn't care if I failed that project, but... I didn't want to fail him. And... Oh man, I- I hope he's okay.
Don't worry, we'll get him back. I'll make sure of it.
STOP!
Stop following me! Belos could be anywhere by now, and we're just- SITTING HERE!
...we should make sure he doesn't pace himself into the boiling sea.
Good call. Besides, you're probably the only one strong enough to drag him back up.
Willow? Hold on. How are you feeling?
Don't worry about me! You heard what Gus said, I- I'm the reliable one!
It's okay to be scared too. It's not good if you try to hold it all in.
I'm fine, really! And I think you'll be fine too. You and Luz are a lot alike.
Hey.
Hey.
Did... you think sitting in a nest was... gonna help your palisman hatch?
Maybe. But nothing's happening.
Remember what the Bat Queen said. To connect with the palisman, you need to express your deepest wish.
I never asked. How did you connect with your palisman?
Well, after being handled the staff, I said "I wanna be a great witch! Or... uh, I don't know, I... wanna be an author like Mildred Featherwhyle!" But... she wouldn't move, until I admitted that... I don't know what I'm gonna be when I grow up, but... I wanna choose the path myself. And that was enough.
I wanna be a witch, and help my friends. But doing one always seem to mess up the other. Why did this get so complicated?
You just gotta be patient.
And this isn't the... only reason you're in here. Is it?
I'll find Eda and King. No matter how long it takes.
IT'S EDA AND KING!
They were on that shooting star!
How are we supposed to follow them?
Don't worry.
I'm a safe flier.
Flier??
Whoo, those things need seatbelts.
Hello, sweet earth.
I- I mean, hello, good sir...?
Where are Eda and King?
Where is... anyone?
Something's coming.
Witches?
Demons?
No, it- it's... sparkles??
Dad?!
Stop, it's- it's me! Have you seen papa? Wait!
Eda...?
Stop right there, beast!
Fear not, citizens of Bonesborough! I'm here to stop this beast's mad rampage!
I believe in you, Collector!
Thanks, best friend!
Light glyph, GO!!!
Oh, hooray. I'm back to normal.
What??
Who's got a pint of Apple Blood? Hoot hoot.
Time out, everyone! Time out!
Terra, for the last time, Eda doesn't sound like that! She's got more of a- like a- a cool aunt vibe who pretends to be all cold-hearted but actually cares a lot!
Ugh, you're a real thorn in my side, you know that? I've had it with YOU and your STUPID LITTLE DOG!
Ugh, whatever. All I have to do is play Eda the Owl Lady and I don't get turned into one of those things, right? Then, let's just continue. "Oooh, I LIKE MUSICIANS!" 
You're not being very nice right now!
Wait!
Collector, buddy, you gotta stop doing that. Think about what you're doing to these people!
You are so BO-RING! I'm just playing pretend!
Even playing pretend has consequences. A cranky old witch taught me that.
You mean Eda, right? That's what we need! The real thing! A cranky, know-it-all, mentor figure. No substitutes allowed! Maybe if I ask real nice, I wouldn't have to turn her into a puppet!
N- No! Her curse is still... um... in effect.
But I can check if she's feeling better.
You promise?
You can trust me, Collector.
Is that the little King guy you were telling me about?
Mm-hmm.
¡Ay, qué lindo! (Translation: Oh, how cute!)
Come on, King! Let's go back to the Archive House.
Wait, no! Not yet!
King...
O- Okay, okay. The eyeballs in the ground are normal, but the little space cherub is the danger??
We should follow them. Belos is probably trying to get back to The Collector!
I- It looked like they were... playing a game.
Yeah, with some kind of... messed up version of my life! King must have told them about our adventures.
Do you think everyone who was turned into a puppet gets locked in the Archives?
If they do, then that's where we have to go.
You'll never make it.
Hmm?
‘cause you guys are LO-SERS! 
Since the Golden Guard... I- I mean Hunter, told us about the Emperor's plan for the Day of Unity, Principal Bump allowed students and teachers to camp out at Hexside.
We thought we could handle whatever the Emperor threw at us.
But when the Draining Spell hit...
...we realized things wouldn't be so simple.
After the adults recovered...
That's when The Collector's Spies showed up.
The grudgby team snuck out, and tried to hold them back, but...
Huh?
It didn't work.
Bump and the adults were turned into toys and taken away!
We've been hiding here ever since.
And somewhere along the way, I went from being Mattholomule...
... to "Man"tholomule.
Shhh!
We did a little redecorating these past few months. So let me welcome you to...
...new Hexside!
This does not smell great.
Heads up!
T-shirts! Get your T-shirts!
Bootleg candy! Now that your mama's a puppet, it's time to eat that candy!
I'll save you, father!
Let the blood of your enemies give you strength!
This, is a statue of Principal Bump, who risked his life for ours.
It's so nice to see teachers getting the respect they deserve.
...I think.
Do you see who's back?
Look who it is.
Oh my gosh, it's Amity.
Hey, where've you guys been? Who's tall Luz?
Willow!
I'm so glad you're back! Your orchids have become sentient and have started a war with a roving gang of kindergarteners. Please help!
No! Human paper clips are NOT a good meat substitute! Have people been eating those??
Mittens?!
Em!
Heya, sis!
Amity!!!
Oh. My. Titan!
Ed, you're gonna hurt yourself!
I don't care, I wanna hug my sister!
Siblings!
What happened??
After you and dad left the factory, I BRAVELY set off to find you. Then I was tragically cornered by one of the Collector's spies.
When he was running away, he fell into an empty well.
Not empty! There were rocks at the bottom.
Come here you weirdos!
No offense, but this seems a bit...
Disgusting.
Yeah, but... we're just... following orders.
From who?
Attention! Would Captain Tholomule escort his guests to the Council Chamber? And DO IT NOW!
Captain WHO?
Wait, has Tholomule been your last name this whole time?!
Oh, shut up.
There has to be one left...
Boy, oh boy. We were gone for a while.
I should probably uh, go check on the ol' Owl Beast. Maybe get her something to eat?
What do mortals eat again? Rocks? Fire? Gravity?
Welcome home, Collector.
Did you have a pleasant adventure?
Mamadalia, we need to feed the Owl Beast. Hmmm, how about... pizza bagels?
I told you before, Collector, I could be much more use to you than being a... Mamadalia. Maybe we can talk about... remaking the Boiling Isles into something bigger and better!
PI-ZZA BAGELS!
Oh, and one more thing.
Drag those back to the collection room, will ya? K thanks bye!
We've been playing pretend for-ever, King. It is fun, but... what if we switch it up? We can play "Capture the Flag"! Us versus... everyone on the Isles! We can put the losers on the moon!
Wow! That is... an idea. But... don't you think people would have a tough time breathing?
So they can hold their breaths.
Hey, King!
Can you read me a sto-ry?
Easy.
Okay... "Collectors live long, we watch things pass. To preserve, to observe, we must amass. What flies, what swims, be it predator, or prey, seal them up so they may never fade." Uh...
NO, NO, NO! Don't read the next part! Skip to where I fixed it.
Uh, okay. "But playing is more fun, so I'm gonna make friends instead, the others stink, boo!"
King? Can I sleep with Francois? 
Come on, you know I've... only let one other person hold him.
Right, that human. Can you at least leave him to watch over me? I don't like being alone...
Uh... so... if... we got a group to... organize supplies, we can keep track of perishables, and... that way, we won't have to... fight over food anymore.
Hmmm...
President, if I may be so bold.
President?!
This would take valuable resources away from your guard. You don't want to be "collected" like the others, do you?
Good point, Miki. Next! 
Oh my gosh, it's you guys!
Did she take any of our ideas?
No, uh... Sorry, I gotta make sure the kindergarteners aren't hunting down lockers again. It was a blood bath last time. So glad you're alive!
Uh, Boscha, we found-
Allow me to introduce Student Body President Boscha! And her trusted guards, Miki and Roka.
Welcome to new Hexside! Home to the future of the Isles and... stuff.
What the heck is going on here??
Yeah, Hexside doesn't even have a student council! I would know, I kept trying to organize one, but Bump thought I was too "obsessed" and-
Alright girl, take a breath.
And who are you two? 
My little sister and I were travelling for the Day of Unity, but found ourselves hiding here after the uh... incident. Boscha brought us in so... we helped to establish order over Hexside.
Now, we are flourishing!
Tell my story!!!
Well, first of all, I'd like to introduce you to my mama, Camila!
And honorary Hexolio, Hunter!
Long story short, we're here to help. We're gonna rescue everyone from the Archives and SAVE the Boiling Isles!
...not the reaction I was expecting.
As the leader, the safety of Boscha's subjects is paramount. And this is a suicide mission! After the horrors her own grudgby team faced-
Ugh, quiet! I don't need to hear that again! But... Miki's right. We're staying put.
But-
And that's THAT!
What just happened??
It's been like this ever since Miki and Roka showed up! We want to fix stuff around here, but... anytime we suggest something, Miki threatens to throw people into the Detention Pit.
The WHAT?!
Maybe there's another way... I don't know how to get into the Archives, but... we may be able to get close. By teleporting DIRECTLY into the Titan's skull!
Oh, it's getting tangled.
Wait! Wait, can you uh... give me that one?
Hmm?
Eda, come on. Not right now.
Wait!
You gotta stop leaving your room! The Collector thinks you are still in Beast mode.
I know...
I just like visiting Raine.
Lily! Guess who King found!
In a moment, Edalyn.
Drink this. I think I got it right this time.
Lily, it's actually impressive how the taste keeps getting worse. But it does work! Keep it up and you'll put Morton out of business.
Great! Now, can you do something about this guy?
Hootsifer! Is he okay? Can he hear me? HOOTSIFER! CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Sequestered at a darkness like unto death, the dulcet tones of an angel wakes me. Be it you?? LULU??!!
It be, IT BE!
Hooty, you keep finding new and impressive ways to creep me out.
Maybe the Collector can release him too! Like you and Lilith!
No, you are already putting yourself at enough risk just for us.
Ah, Lily's right. If The Collector finds out you are lying, we could all turn into puppets for good.
Huh?
What's the matter?
I don't know. I just miss Luz.
Oh, I miss her too, kiddo. But she's in the Human Realm now with... you know, her real family.
Don't say it like that! You know you don't mean it.
What Eda means to say is... we'll find a way to defeat The Collector.
At least Luz and her friends are safe, and far, far away from this madness.
Okay, the coast is clear.
This, is where me and Jerbo had been trying to come up with plans to make Hexside more livable.
Keep it in, keep it in! Oh!
Plans to convert the gym into a common space? Schedules for rotating guard shifts? Is that a dinner menu using veges from the Plant Homeroom?? Mattholomule, you are actually a decent leader!
Did you ever have any doubt in your mind?
Yes. Many many doubts.
Alright. Time to take a walk down memory lane.
Once, I saw Philip- I mean, Belos, use a glyph to teleport to the skull. But... it may take some digging to find it.
Remember, Luz. No schemes, no plots, no ruses.
And definitely no shenanigans.
...I'm gonna assume those are clean.
No.
It's not ready.
Put that one over there. No, no, no, over there!
Making a deal with that child was a waste of time! I wish someone would see my potential.
Oh yes, I think you'll prove to be quite useful.
Me?
No.
You!
I think we found it.
Whoa, it's so clear! We can use this to get to the skull!
Finally. We can get moving again.
Before we go... Look what I found.
We're all gonna miss Flapjack, but... we know he loved you the most.
And we just wanna let you know, we don't care who you're supposed to be. ‘cause you are one of us now. Never forget that.
Hunter, are you okay?
I... don't know.
Oh, um... I'm... sorry, I... didn't mean to make things worse.
I, uh... I'll be right back.
I guess this is my fault too.
What? How?
I've known you were a grimwalker since the Day of Unity. I was waiting for you to bring it up yourself but... I... I- I don't know. Maybe if I weren't so afraid, none of us would be hurting right now.
Gus, I- I...
It's okay. You stay here, I'll find Willow.
Wait, Gus!
Willow! Gus! Wait up, please!
Trouble with your team, Captain Half-a-witch?
Leading isn't easy, is it? All your time is spent helping the team. Keeping people from fighting. Planning your next move. And Titan forbid YOU show any weakness! Everyone else falls apart.
Not now, Boscha.
If you want my advice...
Advice? From you? You have been nothing but petty and mean to me since I met you! What, you want me to give up? You want me to admit how stressed I am? What advice could you possibly give me?!
Actually, I was gonna advice you to watch your back.
You never know when your opponent is gonna strike.
Woof! They're not coming back, are they?
You kids have gone through too much. Even when we rescue your families, there're still so much to fix.
At least we'll all be together to figure it out. Right, Luz? 
Amity... I should tell you something.
Ha! So the rumours were true. You were trying to stage a coup, little Mattholumule!
Yeah! We were! ‘cause you guys are the worst!
No!!! Not you!
Long time no see, human.
Kikimora!
What's that smell?
Sleeping nettles!
Most important rule of Grudgby: "Always expect the unexpected".
You're not supposed to move on your own! How did you break your spell?
The spell isn't broken.
See? You take such good care of us Coven Heads, Collector, keeping us safe in the Archives. It was the uh... power of your kindness that brought me to life, so I could tell you-
What is it?!
You're in danger, Collector.
What gives, Kikimora? Are you working for The Collector?
The days of Kikimora the underling are over. I prefer partnership such as ours. We need to establish our rule now, for the well-being of future generations.
Okay, I'm still catching up. What's the little red kitten trying to do?
She's just copying Belos' "scare people into worship" thing because she has NO IDEAS OF HER OWN!
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this!
You think I'd just drop you in and walk away? No, I think I'll take you out myself!
Boscha, come on!
This is a bit much, even for you!
Ah! I don't deserve this!
I- I- I- I think I remember the Ice glyph!
Mama, wait!
Mama? Amity?
Don't think you've won just yet!
Kiki-miki!
Uh... bruja toss!
Luz? Camila! Are you okay?
Let us go, Boscha.
Oh, Amity. I already let you go. Many times. When you stop hanging out with the group, when you left the grudgby team, when you disappeared for months!
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
Please come back!
Huh?
Eh?
The others are gone, but... we can still be a team! We can rule New Hexside together. It'll be just like the old days! And maybe even better!
Sorry, we don't have time for this.
I won't let you leave again!
Boscha, you're hurting me!
Run!
Got you now, Blight!
Huh??
Cool, right? A little illusion trick Augustus taught me.
But... Where's Amity? She didn't leave, did she?
I can't be who you want me to be, Boscha. But we can still save your teammates. Would you let us try?
Hey, Gus! Gus, Gus, are you okay? Can you hear me? Gus, wake up!
Huh? What? Ah! Boscha!
It's okay! It's okay, it's just me.
What... happened? I remember smelling sleeping nettles.
Yeah, and... I think I saw Kikimora, which is definitely a bad sign. That way is all caved in so-
This way. Yeah. I'm ready to kick some new Hexside butt.
Oh, Flapjack... Everyone's on edge and I don't know what to say. I wish you were here.
Huh?
Gus!
Oh, Hunter!
I had a little run-in with Boscha and got stuck down here. Gus just... surprised me.
What's going on? 
I've got it all under control.
Uh, I don't think it's working!
I can do this. I can do this. I can do this! I can do this... I can do this...!
Hello...?
Me? I'm in danger?
Ah, good one.
It's true. Someone very close to you is planning their betrayal, right- now.
You don't mean King, right? I don't know if you've noticed, but... he's my best friend.
And... where is he now?
Alright, King. According to these uh... borrowed books, Titan magic can actually cancel out the Collector's. And that's why his predecessors... Well, uh...
Wiped out all the Titans?
The important thing is that there is hope to defeat him. Maybe even trap him again.
No! We can't do that!
Hear that? He's looking out for me.
Why not?
‘cause it didn't work!
If we want things to go back to normal, The Collector needs to be stopped for good! And I think I know a more permanent solution.
That didn't sound... very friendly.
You know, the human is here too.
Luz? Why is she back?
Obviously, to help King put an end to you. And your little games.
No! No, no, no! You're fibbing, you're definitely fibbing!
...right?
The Collector is just a little kid. A scary, powerful one, but... also... sad, and alone. I don't know, this whole time, I was scared of making him mad, but... I think I can relate to him.
Let me talk to him. Immortal being to semi-immortal being. It's worth a try if no more people get hurt. Right?
Oh, you're growing up too fast for me, kiddo. 
Come on out, you humans.
You can't hide forever!
My whole plan fell apart, I- I messed up again!
What are you talking about?
It doesn't matter.
No, mija. It does matter.
You don't want to leave the Demon Realm, do you?
Of course not! But...
You keep messing up? Messing up is a part of living! You don't think I've ever messed up before? Ha! Okay, well, once I scheduled my wisdom tooth surgery the day before my wedding. Oh, then there was that time I got road rage and didn't realize I was cursing out your new principal. And, you know, I sold energy drinks for a pyramid scheme for 3 years! And of course, I was convinced we should move to Gravesfield to be closer to that fancy hospital. You know how that ended.
And worst of all, I didn't stand up for you when you needed me most. I forgot about the Astral Oath.
The what?
The Astral Oath is a promise made between Captain Avery and his family, to love and protect each other just as they are... Through supernovas, and solar winds.
Mom... are you a secret nerd?
I had a hard time growing up. I was afraid you would too. My biggest mistake was trying to protect you, by changing this beautiful Good Witch into something she wasn't.
I think I just... realized something.
I don't know why it took me so long to figure out.
The only thing I've ever really wanted...
...was to be understood!
Found you!
Gus? Hunter?
Gus!
I can do this. I can do this!
I can do this! I can do this... I can't do this.
I can't control my own magic. I can't help my friends. Ugh, why have I been trying to be someone different? Boscha's right, I'll always just be... half-a-witch Willow.
You didn't make anything worse, you didn't do anything wrong! You guys mean the world to me, and I... I didn't know how to say that yet. Just please don't call yourself that ever again. You've been holding in a lot, haven't you?
Willow!
Reliable people need someone to rely on too!
Just let it out, we'll be fine! 
I miss my dads...
Hey! 
Hunter, how did you do that?
Do what?
You have magic, dude!
The... magic of friendship?
No! The magic of FLAPJACK!
Huh?
Sorry! I'm still getting the hang of this.
Luz has a staff.
Why does that make me nervous?
There you are! I'm done playing hide-and-seek!
Yep, that's better.
She's fine. This is child's play for us.
Whoa, what did I miss?
I missed a lot!
I don't need this wretched school to start my own empire. I'll make my own! And I'll start by taking you apart, piece by piece, brat by brat!
Stop right there! Miki, I can't say I'm surprised by this. As for you, Roka...
I know there's been nothing but chemistry between us. Be that as it may, I-
That's a robot, Matt.
They'll hold her back. Let's get to the skull!
Hey, Boscha. Don't think this means I'm finish with you. 
Whatever. I didn't do this for any of you. I just want to do normal things, and look great, and play grudgby with MY TEAM!
I can't tell what you're gonna be, but... thank you, little friend!
This is my empire now! You have to obey ME!
We... we made it!
Oh my gosh! 
I can't believe that actually worked!
Well you really beamed us up, eh, O'Bailey?
Beam us up! Beam us up! Beam us up!
Guys?
Come meet my Palisman!
What kind of magical creature will it be? A dragon?
A bird?
Oh, an otter!
A spooky bat?
A... snake?
You are close. 
She's a snake shifter! Her name is Stringbean, and she's PERFECT!
¡Pero mira que preciosos mis bebés! ¡Ven, ven! (Translation: Oh look at all of mama's precious babies. Come here, come here.)
Thanks for what you said back there. You mean a lot to me too.
Cool. Happy to help.
Can't wait to show Eda and King.
They'll love her. Although Hooty might eat her.
King might too.
Eda might three.
What did I tell you? Luz has come to help King get rid of you for good. What will you do, Collector?
I think I wanna play a new game.
