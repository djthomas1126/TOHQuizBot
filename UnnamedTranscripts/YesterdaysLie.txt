Ah! Much better.
Hmm.
What's the box for, mija? 
Just cleaning up a little. 
Even this? You used to love making me tinfoil swans.
Oh, I'm, uh, just looking for a fresh start.
Camp taught me a lot, you know? 
Yes, it sure did...
Ah! Luz, grab the pliers.
Okay, okay, little bunny, you're gonna be all right. There we go.
That's the fifth trap this week!
If I ever catches who's responsible and then I'll pa-pow!
Let's go back inside. I will make maduros.
A new life. 
You! 
So, according to Philip's instructions, the hardest part to making a portal was finding someone who knew how to build it. But a lot of the ingredients are pretty easy to find. Your crazy apocalypse supplies finally came in handy, Eda!
Don't forget this. 
Titan blood. I can't believe something this powerful was in the old key this whole time.
It's okay. If Belos is still trying to get to the Human Realm, he'll have to beat me to it.
Are you sure this isn't gonna like, blow our faces off?
Nope!
Well, here goes something.
It... worked! 
Did it? That looks real different from the old door!
Yeah. But this is my one chance to see my mom. If it looks like it's closing, pull!
Luz, as impressive as this is, I don't want you getting hurt.
Once I make sure my mom is okay, I'll be right back.
Just be careful. The Human Realm's filled with some real weirdos. 
Mmm!
Don't forget to mention me!
Okay.
Did I... do something wrong? Eda? King? Hooty? Can anyone hear me?
Am I... back at the Owl House?
Whoa! Whoa, I think I'm... in the reflection! 
Do you think she's safe?
She's made it this far. We just have to trust her.
I wonder if I can see... Amity! 
Ah! Ugh! No, no, no! Come on, Luz, you're on a mission! Camila! Camila Noceda of the Human Realm?
Got ya! Ice platform!
Fine then! I'll do this the hard way!
Mom!
It's my house!
Mom!
Oh yeah.
Mo—
Mom? Do you need any help?
Oh, are you done cleaning your room?
Almost! With all that old stuff gone, I feel like a whole new person.
Evil doppelgänger! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!
I can finish up here, mija.
Thanks, Mom! 
Follow her! Luz Noceda 2.0! Doppelgänger! Why won't you work?! Okay, Luz, calm down. Just breathe and count to five.
A new life. 
You!
So you can hear me.
You're from the Demon Realm.
Listen, I just wanna—
I'm not going back! I—I won't go back! 
Luz? ¿Está todo bien?
Sí, Mama! I just saw a spoiler from Monster Slayer Academia!
I'll never understand anime.
Hmm?
Wait!
So this is it. I'm gonna have to run... again. Why couldn't this just work out?!
Stop moving! You'll make it tighter!
Huh?
I didn't mean to freak you out. I just want to figure out what's going on, okay? You're a demon from the Boiling Isles, aren't you?
Mm-hmm. 
What's your name?
I'm Number F—I mean, I'm Vee.
Okay Vee, I'm gonna help free you. You're gonna be alright. Now, back up a bit, give the wire some slack. Now, look for a little metal thingamabobber. Sorry, I don't know what it's called.
There you go, nice and easy.
Ah! Thank you. You must be Camila's real daughter.
I am. But right now, I'm trapped in the Boiling Isles. Who are you, why are you pretending to be me?
I am... just looking for a place to belong.
You're missing and mom... I mean, Camila seemed so kind, so I stayed with her but uh, I'll go if you—
Wait, wait, wait! Maybe we can help each other! Today I was gonna tell my mom where I've been, but because of you, she hasn't realized that I've been missing! So, keep living in my place! For now. When I get back, I can introduce her to the Demon Realm and help you find a place to live.
There's one problem. I need magic to transform and I, uh... just used the rest of it.
Hmm... Oh! That's where we can get some magic!
Secrets of Gravesfield?
No, no, that's junk. Turn it over.
Strange woman banned from café.
That's Eda the Owl Lady. She's been coming here for years. She might have left some magic stuff behind!
Okay! We can try.
Is this it? Huh, I—I just go in and ask about that witch from the paper?
Yes. Maybe they still have one of her enchanted pastries! Huh? Ears! Ears!
Hello!
What can I get ya?
Uh, have any, um, magical old ladies left enchanted items here?
Ugh, you're not friends with that witch-obsessed guy, right? I told him to stop leaving pamphlets here!
Actually, I'm asking about her.
Oh, Marylin?
Yeah, she tried to pay for a latte with a live raccoon a couple of months ago. But when I called the cops, she did something weird to the croissants. We threw 'em in the trash but... Well, now we have a whole new problem.
I don't... smell any magic. Huh?
Bread of wisdom grants us speech. We desire more!
Cool! Talking rats! Maybe they know something.
Vee? Is everything alright?
Oh, yeah, I—I just don't like confrontation. 
Oh! Well, that's okay. I'm sure there's someone else who's seen Eda. There!
Hexes Hold'em cards! Eda got rid of all her decks. I was wondering where they went...
Well, they must've run out of magic, I don't... smell anything.
But maybe they know where to get more! Okay, we gotta be careful approaching high schoolers. Mark all your exit routes—
Actually, these guys are cool. 
Ah! Wait, hey!
A past connection that left its mark on your soul has shown up again, and it's asking you to shed your old ways and enter a metamorphosis! Becoming a spiritual leader, you're meant to be.
Yeah, that sounds about right. 
Hello!
Oh, she's gonna embarrass herself! I can't watch...
Oh, hey, Luz! Good to see you outside of prison.
Come on! Camp wasn't that bad.
Camp?
We did have the best cabin!
Cabin 7! Hoo-ha-ha! 
Cool cards! Where'd you get 'em?
Uh-uh. Let me give you a reading first. I wanna practice.
Woah.
You're running from your past. From a previous life that was not kind to you. However, the guilt and fear you carry will eventually catch you in a self-fulfilling prophecy that you won't be able to escape from.
You're gonna need some bath bombs, girl.
Anyway, I got the cards over at the Gravesfield Historical Society.
Thanks. I'll see you around.
Did you see the look in her eyes? I gotta find out where she got those contacts.
Is it that dusty in here? Welcome to the Gravesfield Historical Society. Lemme guess, you're here to buy those weird cards, right?
How did you know?
Well, they've been really popular with high schoolers. Yeah, saw an old lady try to dump 'em in a river a while back, but I bought them off her instead. Was really odd though, she kept asking for snails.
This is it!
You want a set?
Yes, please!
Well, I'll be just a minute, so feel free to look around.
Are you okay? Hey, forget what that girl said! I know what it's like to run away from home. I did the same thing.
You and I are not the same. You had a mom who loved you, a home, a life, you had it good! And you still wanted to run away, I... I didn't have a choice. My real name is... Number Five. I'm a basilisk, and technically, I... I shouldn't exist.
My kind went extinct a long time ago, but we were brought back.
They wanted to know how we drained magic.
I met a basilisk once. She hurt a lot of people.
For many of us, all we knew how to do was feed.
Some of us escaped, but I knew it was only a matter of time before he caught us again.
That's when I saw you, and... and realized there might be a way out of this!
Luz? Where are you?
Eeh! 
Luz? There you are.
Hello... fellow human! Um... skin's sure weird!
Very funny. But, I was thinking, instead of taking the bus to camp, why don't we drive? I got the day off from work, and you'll have full control of the playlist.
I didn't mean to keep playing this role, but... Camila was nice to me.
I resent you for running away. But I'm also thankful that you did. I dunno. It's... confusing.
Do you smell something?
Where's the light?
What is all this?
Vee? Vee? Vee?
Vee!
Let me out!
Woah, it worked?
I—I can't believe it, are you real? After all that time, after setting up all those traps, I... I finally caught a living, breathing demon! Oh, don't be surprised. A few years back I had a chance encounter with another one of your kind. 
Yeah, at first I couldn't believe what I saw, but after watching a few MewTube videos I learned the truth. Witches and demons are real...
... and they're all sent from Mars to harvest human teeth to power their time machine!
You... don't actually know anything about us, do you?
Oh, I know enough. I'll expose your vile plans on MewTube and finally... get my account verified. Get comfortable, demon. Cause you'll be in cages for the rest of your life. 
Don't worry, Vee, we can get out of this...
Go back to the Demon Realm, Luz.
Huh?
Even if I get out, he knows what my disguise looks like. He'd out me to Camila and it'd would cause her more trouble than if you just disappeared.
Vee! You're giving up too quick!
I'm being realistic. It's okay, I'm used to living like this. Goodbye, Luz.
No!
Vee! Five! Number Five! Agh! 
Camila Noceda.
Boop.
Mom, are you there?
Huh? Luz? I didn't even hear you call!
Mom. It's so great to hear your voice.
Oh. It's great to hear you too? What's wrong?
I found out who's setting up those traps, and he's... hurting a friend of mine. But first... I have to tell you the truth. About the last few months. Let me tell you about a place called Boiling Isles.
You know, if you wanted me to pick you and your friend up, you didn't have to make up this elaborate story about the "Demon Realm".
I'm not making it up, Mom.
Don't worry, I'll play along. I know this stuff made school difficult, but I'm glad you're still being creative.
Are you the curator here?
Who's askin'?
A little birdie told me you caught a demon! I would love to see it!
Wait, how did you know? Do you work for the government?
Oh. I'm a veterinarian, actually.
So, the President sent a vet to study the demon's anatomy, huh? Sure. But first, I'll need verbal confirmation that I get to publish my findings first. 
Uh... 'kay.
Good. Now you're bound by law. Follow me.
You even made me a part of your game! Ooh, This is so fun.
Ooh! Is this one of those escape rooms? Or, um, what do you call them, a LARP? Oh, sorry, don't want to break the illusion.
Let me start by telling you the secret history of Gravesfield.
In the 1600s, this was a peaceful colony. Until, tragedy struck.
Two brothers were lured into a realm of evil by a real witch, never to be seen again. People have stopped believing in the horrors of witchcraft, but... I know the truth.
Woah. Luz, this is quite a detailed story.
But now I've got proof that otherworldly beings exist! Behold!
Oh, wow! That is a very... convincing... costume? 
A costume? This is a real life demon! C'mere, watch this.
More vile beings will probably come to its rescue. But I can protect humanity. I even had some custom gear made at the renaissance fair. Usually I don't take it out for just anyone, but what the heck! If I'm gonna be working with the government, I might as well show off a little.
Luz, come on. I don't like this game anymore.
It's not a game, Mama. Everything I told you was true.
So that thing has been living with me the entire time? It's just a lot to believe...
Her name is Vee, and she may look different, but she's not bad. Please, you gotta help her!
Hello... this is all so confusing, but... who knew I had such a strong girl living under my roof this whole time?
So how do I look? Maybe we can collaborate on a version that can survive the battles on Mars? Wait, what is that? Are you recording this?
Uh...
Wonderful! Well I was gonna wait until after the press tour, but let's begin our live dissection of this demon right now!
Stop! Uh, the... the President just called. Yeah, and, uh...
Uh... Y'know what? I don't have the imagination for this. I will be taking this innocent child with me, and you will never bother us again.
What? No absolutely not! We made a verbal agreement—
Mister. You better back the heck down, or I will tell the police you have been illegally setting up traps and cameras on private property! 
I won't let you take away my discovery. I'm the good guy here!
Yeah. A lot of bad guys say that.
Is it okay to leave him in there?
He'll be fine.
He can use the time for some self-reflection.
Heh! Look what I can do with the rain! Vee! I'm so happy you're okay!
Woah.
Yeah. Thank you, Camila. For everything.
Vee. You have a place here for as long as you need. And take these. Luz said they might be helpful for you.
Magic!
Mom, you were awesome back there! Thanks for being cool... about everything.
I'm trying to hold it together... I really am... But I have never been this scared before. A demon realm? Magic? How are you gonna get back here? Is this the only way I can touch you?
I... I need a little more time, but if I keep working my hardest I will make a working portal, I promise!
As scary as this is, it really does seem like you've matured.
Yes! I've learned so much... Staying here was the best decision I ever made.
You... chose to stay there?
Oh, uh...
Were you trying to live out some witch fantasy? Did you... did you hate living with me that much? 
Mama, no!
No. Not yet. Not... yet! Mom!
I'm being pulled back!
Baby? No, no, no, no, no, no... When you come home, promise you'll stay here. I didn't mean to push you away. I swear things will be different.
Mom, it's not you, it never was!
Promise me, Luz... please!
Okay, Mom. I promise. 
Mom! 
And pull, and pull, and...
Luz! 
I'm sorry, I had to pull you out. The portal was closing.
Did you talk to your mom? Did you mention me?
Yeah. Mama... Mom can't wait to meet you guys.
Well, just rest up now, okay? And don't you worry, kiddo. With everything we've learned, we'll have a real working portal in no time.
I'm gonna eat human snacks!
I can't wait to share parenting tips!
Who dubbed you a parent?
